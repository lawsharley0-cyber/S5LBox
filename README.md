# NEON

### Project goal: boot **real iPhone OS 3** — Apple's actual kernel, `launchd`, and SpringBoard — inside an app on a modern iPhone. **No jailbreak required** — see *Requirements*.

*A from-scratch emulator of the 2007 iPhone's chip, written in portable C.*

*Formerly **S5LBox**. Renamed NEON on 2026-09-25 as the project grows an ARMv7
Cortex-A8 CPU towards iOS 6 on the iPhone 3GS; see
[`docs/IOS6_READINESS.md`](docs/IOS6_READINESS.md). Older docs and internal
names still say S5LBox, and the bundle ID is unchanged, so an install updates
the app already on a phone.*

NEON does not reimplement iPhone OS or fake its apps. It emulates the
**hardware** of the original iPhone — the Samsung **S5L8900** chip and its ARMv6
processor — in software, then runs Apple's own unmodified operating system on
top of that model. You supply the firmware; none is included here. To the
maintainers' knowledge no publicly documented open-source emulator has booted
iPhone OS 3.x to a home screen (the nearest prior art reaches 1.1 and 2.1.1 on
emulated iPod touch hardware) — positioning, not proof that no private
implementation exists.

## What this is, and what it is not

Read this before anything else on this page.

**What is real:** your own unmodified iPhone OS 3.1.3 (7E18) firmware executes.
Apple's real kernel (XNU 1357.5.30) boots, Apple's own drivers start, the real
root filesystem mounts, and the real background programs run: `launchd`,
`securityd`, `installd`, `mDNSResponder`, `fairplayd`, `itunesstored`,
`lockbot`, `CommCenter`, SpringBoard. The clearest evidence that this is
genuinely Apple's stack and not a reimplementation of it: when SpringBoard
crashed, the guest's **own** crash reporter wrote real crash reports into its
own filesystem, and that is how that blocker was diagnosed. The project
ships no Apple firmware and never modifies the files you supply.

**What it reaches:** as of 2026-07-30 a host-delivered gesture **slides the lock
screen open and reaches the home screen** — icons, the dock, and Apple's own
first-run tip — composited by Apple's software renderer onto the emulated panel.

Every frame on this page was drawn by the guest's own SpringBoard through
Apple's CPU compositor and scanned out through the emulated display
controller. Nothing in any of them is drawn by the host.

*run85, instruction 3.5e9 — the lock screen. 273,206 of 460,800 framebuffer
bytes non-zero, 92,145 non-black pixels in 44,087 colours. Reached by giving
`/vram` room for a second surface; with one, the same boot drew 1,659.*

</div>

<div align="center">

*r194 — the home screen, reached by a slide-to-unlock and then a tap on
*Dismiss*, both delivered by the emulator. Every icon composited by Apple's own
software renderer. Its control r195 — same build, same instruction count, no
tap — still has the dialog on screen.*

</div>

**Touch works, end to end.** The emulated Z2 digitizer has no flash, so Apple's
driver downloads its 54,156-byte firmware over the undocumented HBPP protocol on
every boot — and says so itself: *"downloaded 54156 bytes of firmware data
("0x0049.bin") in 106ms"*. A gesture the host then injects is read by
`AppleMultitouchZ2SPI`, normalised by MultitouchSupport, turned into an
`IOHIDEvent` by Apple's MultitouchHID plugin, and delivered to SpringBoard,
where it **drags the unlock knob and opens the phone**. The knob tracks the
finger: measured at centre 57.5, 80.5 and 156.5 as the contact advances.

**A tap works too, and it has a control.** r194 taps *Dismiss* on Apple's
first-run dialog and the dialog goes. r195 is the same build at the same
instruction count with no tap, and the dialog is still on screen. The two runs
are deterministic apart from that one contact, so the tap is what dismissed it.

**What is not real, and this is the honest remainder:**

- **Two fingers reach userspace; no two-finger gesture has moved anything yet.**
  A pinch delivered 26 frames carrying **two contacts each**, and Apple's
  `_mt_FillMTContactDirectFromBinary` — called once per contact — was entered
  exactly 78 times: 26 for the one-finger unlock plus 52 for the pinch. So
  simultaneous contacts do traverse the device, the driver and the normaliser.
  What has *not* been shown is an app responding to one, because a pinch on the
  home screen has nothing to zoom.
- **System sounds play; ringtones do not.** Since the I²S frame clock was
  modelled, PCM DMA runs on the device, and with the guest's Ring/Silent
  switch moved once (controls menu: Silent, then Ring) the user hears keyboard
  clicks, lock sounds and the rest, with some lag (build 2ecac70). Ringtones
  are AAC and need the hardware decoder (AMC), which is not modelled
  (`docs/audio.md`).
- **No packet has been carried.** The PPP link comes up — `IPCP Opened`,
  `10.0.2.15` — and every NAT counter is still zero.
- **30 fps is not established.** User-reported foreground navigation can still
  fall to roughly **0–4 fps** and visibly stall. In the newest exact physical-A9
  Settings replay, the marker-free compact engine's three control arms ended at
  15, 9 and 13 endpoint FPS, with only 1.825–3.262 changed scanouts/s and a
  2.207–3.233 second maximum changed-pixel gap. The repeated-window cache then
  removed about 42% of C fast refills but slowed the same instruction interval
  by 9.5% on average and worsened the median changed-pixel gap, so it remains
  disabled. These counters diagnose the foreground pipeline; they do not prove
  that iOS displayed every submitted frame. No arm reached a 30-fps acceptance
  result. See *Speed* and [`docs/hotpath.md`](docs/hotpath.md).

Two smaller things the picture shows honestly. The clock reads 4:00 on
31 December because the real-time clock answers with a placeholder nobody has
connected to anything. "Searching…" is the status bar correctly reporting no
baseband, which is one of five pieces of hardware deliberately hidden from the
guest. The default also hides the graphics chip and uses Apple's software
renderer; an experimental MBX model now completes the measured live workload,
but has not passed final cold-boot or 30 fps acceptance. The audio hardware is
modelled, but nothing has ever played through it — see the table below.

*run59, instruction 4.97e9 — the first frame. 14,264,987 changed scanout
bytes, 97,510 of 460,800 framebuffer bytes non-zero, against 384 in every
earlier run. Reached by giving `/vram` a real address; with `reg = {0,0}`
userspace received the framebuffer read-only and faulted on its first store.*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Real Apple software** | Your own unmodified 3.1.3 (7E18) firmware: the XNU 1357.5.30 kernel, Apple's own drivers, the real root filesystem, and the real background programs listed above. No Apple firmware is shipped, and the files you supply are never modified on disk. |
| **CPU** | ARM, Thumb and VFPv2 floating point — over the code the boot has actually reached, not the whole architecture. The ARMv6 rules for unaligned memory access are honoured, memory translation enforces no-execute pages, and the system-control coprocessor is modelled. Runs are bit-exact reproducible. |
| **Hardware modelled** | Serial ports, timers, both interrupt controllers, the GPIO controller, display controller, SPI, the multitouch controller, the power-management chip and its I2C bus, the USB controller's configuration registers, and an experimental MBX reset/ring/2D/3D path. The MBX path is substantial but not yet the accepted default. |
| **Touch: works, one finger** | The Z2 is modelled on SPI and **bootloaded exactly as the real part is** — it has no flash, so its 54,156-byte firmware is downloaded on every boot over Apple's HBPP protocol, which had to be reverse-engineered before anything could work. Apple's driver confirms it in its own words: *"downloaded 54156 bytes of firmware data ("0x0049.bin") in 106ms"*. The part then leaves the bootloader, answers interrogation, and streams touch reports. A host gesture reaches SpringBoard and **completes a slide-to-unlock**. Measured through the whole stack: surface bounds `-75..4656` and `-75..7275` read out of the running guest and matching the model exactly, reports paced at 16.000 ms (62.5 Hz), and the knob tracking the contact linearly. A controlled tap dismisses Apple's first-run dialog. Two simultaneous contacts also reach userspace — a pinch's 26 two-contact frames entered Apple's per-contact normaliser exactly 52 times — but no two-finger gesture has yet produced a visible response. |
| **Not modelled as usable devices** | No cellular radio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, camera or accelerometer. MBX is no longer correctly described as absent from the codebase: its experimental model completes the current measured command families, but the default machine still hides it pending final acceptance. |
| **Audio: system sounds play** | The WM8991 codec, both I²S controllers (with a frame clock) and the PL080 DMA engine are modelled, and the app plays what reaches I2S0. On the device, system sounds play once the guest's Ring/Silent switch has been moved (controls menu). Ringtones (AAC) do not: the hardware decoder (AMC) is not modelled. |
| **Networking: a temporary substitution** | The desktop harness now terminates the guest's own stock `pppd` over emulated uart4: LCP and IPCP reach `Opened`, and the guest receives `10.0.2.15`. That is a real advance over the earlier one-way Configure-Request, but **no guest IP packet has crossed the link** and every NAT traffic counter remains zero. The iOS app does not wire the host PPP/NAT endpoint at all. A real iPhone 3G used Wi-Fi or its cellular baseband, so PPP-over-uart4 remains an explicit temporary substitute rather than a claim of radio emulation. |
| **Hidden from the guest by default** | SHA-1 acceleration, cellular/baseband transport and USB are deliberately declared absent by editing only the in-memory device tree, because their rows name measured boot failures. MBX is also hidden in the accepted default, but is now an opt-in experiment rather than an unmodelled register hole. The firmware files on disk are never modified. |
| **Invented register values** | The USB controller's three configuration registers (`GHWCFG1`/`GHWCFG2`/`GHWCFG4`) hold a legal and sufficient configuration. They are **not** measured from real S5L8900 silicon. This is one of the two exceptions the networking row above draws its line around: three constants, named here so nobody has to discover them, and replaceable the day somebody reads the real part. |
| **Rendering** | The accepted default sets `CA_ENABLE_MBX2D=0` in a new work image so QuartzCore uses Apple's CPU renderer. The experimental path leaves MBX matched and now completes a live interval of 1,388/1,388 2D jobs and 8,888/8,888 3D renders with zero decoder rejection or recovery. That interval is checkpoint-derived; final cold-boot and 30 fps acceptance are still open, so MBX is not silently promoted to the default. |
| **Speed** | Not cycle-accurate and not 30 fps. The old monolithic signed graph remains a measured **6.17x A9 regression**, but the current iOS target uses the newer bounded compact signed-static engine with exact interpreter fallback and no runtime code generation. In the newest 7,212 M Settings replay, marker-free cache-OFF controls ended at 15, 9 and 13 endpoint FPS and only 1.825–3.262 changed scanouts/s. Repeated-window caching cut C fast refills about 42% yet slowed every same-instruction pair; mean host interval rose 9.54%, median endpoint FPS fell 13→9, and the median maximum changed-scanout gap worsened 3.105→3.614 seconds, so the cache stays off. Earlier User-mode tick batching and exact-witness work remain real efficiency gains, but neither established visible 30 fps. Historical foreground runs near 20 Minsn/s on an iPhone 6s Plus and 40 Minsn/s on an iPhone 16 Pro Max also remained around 0–2 fps, disproving any simple instruction-rate-to-visible-FPS conversion. App telemetry separates validated scanout changes, immutable-image/layer submissions, build cost, and a device-wide Core Animation gauge; a layer submission is not called a displayed frame. |
| **Kernel patches** | The kernel is modified in memory as it loads: a real-time-clock timeout is forced to zero, the root-device lookup is redirected to the emulator's fake disk, and hooks are installed so the guest's disk access reaches the host. Applied only after checking a SHA-256 hash and a nine-segment layout check of the exact 7,942,144-byte kernel. |
| **Storage and saved state** | Not flash memory. The desktop harness creates a fresh writable image per run; the app keeps one per machine. New Cydia guests use a 2 GiB HFSX volume. Older committed guests can be cloned, clean-unmount checked, grown, and independently repaired only when the exact pinned 320,704-byte `Cydia_` identity has the known root:root `0755` legacy tuple; any other bytes or metadata fail closed. Real-image tests proved the added blocks usable beyond the old volume boundary and all durable rename boundaries recover. On one physical iPhone 6s Plus running iOS 15.8.5, real guest shutdown made the volume eligible, both migrations completed, Cydia reorganized, refreshed its manually entered official source, and installed/configured `adv-cmds` 119-6 without `EACCES` or no-space errors. That proves one end-to-end transaction, not general package or upgrade compatibility. Fresh rootfs plans now seed `deb http://apt.saurik.com/cydia/ ./` as root:root `0644`; existing guests are not silently rewritten. Back writes one atomic last-session checkpoint and the next open consumes it once. Ordinary running checkpoints still restore CPU, RAM and the instruction timeline exactly. Full guest shutdown sets `OOCSHDWN.GO_STANDBY`; its saved CPU deliberately loops after quiescing and is not a useful suspend point. The app now validates that checkpoint and its sidecar, preserves the clean work image, discards the powered-off CPU/RAM, and performs a fresh kernel boot. On the same physical iPhone 6s Plus, the exact `9f3d107` artifact cold-booted such a checkpoint to the lock screen, accepted slide-to-unlock, saved the resulting home screen at 3,926.8 M instructions, and reopened it as an exact ordinary restore. The earlier retained-RAM wake experiment did improve PMU/GPIO interrupt fidelity, but it never re-enabled the PMU child or LCD and is not shipped as the recovery claim. The frontend still represents a powered-down guest as running until Back or Power input. Named Take/Open snapshots remain refused because their copy-on-write lifecycle is unfinished. The canonical imported root filesystem is read-only. |
| **Boot chain** | No secure boot chain is executed. The kernel is loaded directly; the boot ROM, the low-level bootloader and iBoot are not run. Apple's firmware container format has been parsed and an extracted bootloader payload executed, but separately, never as a chain. |
| **Optional substitution** | On in the accepted software-render default for a newly prepared work image: SpringBoard's launch configuration gains `CA_ENABLE_MBX2D=0`. It is disabled for the experimental MBX configuration. Changing it later does not rewrite an existing machine image. |
| **Rendering reached, use not** | run59 draws real frames — 14,264,987 changed scanout bytes, 97,510 of 460,800 framebuffer bytes non-zero, against 384 (the pre-guest seed) in every earlier run. What is on screen is the **activation** UI, because that run's guest is unactivated. |
| **Activation, and the home screen** | Provisioning `ActivationState = FactoryActivated` into the work image clears the lockout. That alone used to leave a boot spinner; with the digitizer bootload finished the guest reaches the lock screen and, given a gesture, the home screen. The historical dead ends behind that sentence — a SpringBoard crash loop, a read-only framebuffer, a stalled HBPP download, and a coordinate theory that turned out to be wrong — are in [`docs/BOOTLOG.md`](docs/BOOTLOG.md). |

## Current status

Milestones 0 through 4 are done: the build and test pipeline runs in CI; the
emulated chip runs bare-metal code and prints over its serial port; Apple's
firmware containers parse and a real bootloader payload executes; and the real
XNU kernel boots, starts Apple's own drivers, and mounts the real 413 MiB root
filesystem. Here is that kernel introducing itself over the emulated serial
port, on hardware that exists only as C in this repository:

```
Seatbelt MACF policy initialized
BSD root: md0, major 2, minor 0
AppleS5L8900XIO::start: chip-revision: EVT0
AppleARMPL192VIC::start: _vicBaseAddress = 0xe3141000
AppleS5L8900XSerial: Identified Serial Port on ARM Device=uart0 at 0x3cc00000
AppleMultitouchZ2SPI: successfully started
IOSDIOController::enumerateSlot(): CMD5 failed ... (no card is modelled)
```

Those lines come from **Apple's own kernel extensions**, unmodified, after they
matched the emulated hardware — evidence the guest reached those drivers, not
that every device behind them is complete.

Milestone 5 — `launchd` starts SpringBoard, the home screen renders, and you tap
it — is **substantially reached: the home screen renders and a gesture drives
it.** Three blockers were cleared to get there, and the fourth turned out not to
exist.

The first blocker is fixed. SpringBoard used to die and be restarted roughly
every 470 million instructions — 30 times in a single run — because Apple's
rendering code had been told to use the MBX graphics chip this emulator
deliberately does not provide, and then stored through a null pointer. Setting
`CA_ENABLE_MBX2D=0` in SpringBoard's environment ended that loop: it is a switch
Apple's own code reads, selecting the CPU renderer Apple already ships, so it
needs no GPU emulation. Thirty restarts became one, and SpringBoard went on to
build its interface and make its window visible for the first time.

The second blocker is fixed too, and the guest now renders. SpringBoard used to
die writing the screen, with a memory-protection fault on the very first store.
The cause was four indirections away: `/device-tree/vram` ships with
`reg = {0,0}` and real iBoot fills it in. We load the kernel directly, never run
iBoot, and so never did. Without it Apple's IOSurface layer cannot publish its
video-memory region, the display driver falls back to describing the framebuffer
as output-only, and the kernel then maps output-only memory **read-only** into
the process that wanted to draw on it. Apple's code was correct throughout; we
had simply never told it where video memory lives.

Filling that one property in — the same in-memory device-tree patch this
emulator already applies for the DRAM bank and the panel ID — produced the frame
above: **14,264,987 changed scanout bytes**, where every previous run changed
zero. SpringBoard was still compositing when the run hit its cap.

That run's device is **unactivated**, so what SpringBoard draws is the
activation screen. Provisioning `ActivationState = FactoryActivated` into the
work image clears the lockout and the guest reaches the lock screen.

The third blocker was the touchscreen itself, and it was the hardest. A Z2
digitizer has no flash: the host must download its firmware over Apple's
undocumented HBPP protocol on **every** boot, and until that completes the part
never runs application firmware, so the driver correctly refuses to interrogate
it. Reverse-engineering that protocol took four separate fixes — a chip-select
edge that split a packet header in half, a receive FIFO left full by a
transmit-only DMA burst, an acknowledgement literal that differs between two
senders in the same driver, and one wrong inference that a call probe refuted.

The fourth blocker did not exist. With touch delivered end to end, a drag on the
unlock slider still appeared to do nothing — and five runs were spent hunting a
coordinate bug that was not there. Every screenshot had been captured about four
guest-seconds **after** the finger lifted, and iOS springs the knob back when a
slide falls short, so a working gesture and no gesture rendered the same frame.
Photographing the screen *during* the drag showed the knob tracking the finger
all along; the drag simply ended too early to cross the threshold. The lesson,
recorded in [`docs/multitouch.md`](docs/multitouch.md) §6.17.1, is that "no
difference from baseline" is a null result until the instrument is shown capable
of registering a change.

Milestones are tracked in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md), the run-by-run
history including every dead end in [`docs/BOOTLOG.md`](docs/BOOTLOG.md), and
the diagnosis procedure in [`docs/debugging.md`](docs/debugging.md).

**The desktop harness and iPhone app now share the real guest path.** The app
imports an IPSW supplied by the user, prepares one persistent writable image per
machine, boots the same gated kernel/device-tree/rootfs path, displays the guest
framebuffer, and delivers buttons and touch to the emulated board. With no
firmware it deliberately falls back to a small synthetic test guest and says so.
The desktop `bootkernel` remains the richer diagnostic instrument and is where
the newest full SpringBoard/MBX evidence was captured. The app still lacks its
host PPP endpoint and audio playback, and no on-device run has proved 30 fps.

## How it works

The emulator models the chip, not the operating system: an ARMv6 CPU
interpreter, memory translation, and device models for the serial port, timers,
interrupts, display controller and power management, with the guest's disk
served from a file on the host. Apple's kernel, `launchd` and SpringBoard run on
top, believing they are on a real 2009 iPhone. Everything the emulator claims
about the guest's hardware is handed over at boot as a device tree, which is why
hiding a device means editing that list rather than deleting code. All of it is
plain C11 with no third-party dependencies, so it tests quickly on an ordinary
desktop and drops into the iOS app unchanged; only the display and lifecycle
shell is Apple-specific. Detail in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

The runtime-code-generating translator still exists and is tested, but the boot
loop does not call it and the iOS app excludes it. Stock iOS does not generally
grant JIT execution, and the 30 fps target must be met without it. The old
monolithic build-time-signed AArch64 graph is also retained as rejected
evidence: an exact A9 app-bus replay measured it **6.17x slower** than repeated
interpreter controls.

The current iOS target instead defaults to a newer bounded compact AArch64
engine generated entirely at build time. It creates no runtime code or
writable-executable page and falls back to the interpreter for every unsupported
or unsafe boundary. Marker-free machines keep User-mode window continuation,
while privileged continuation and repeated-window caching remain opt-in after
physical A9 gates failed to improve cadence. The newest cache replay reduced C
fast refills about 42% but made the same 160 M-instruction interval about 9.5%
slower on average; it therefore stays off. Full synthetic, physical and
rejected-engine measurements remain in
[`docs/hotpath.md`](docs/hotpath.md); they are evidence, not FPS multipliers.

A portable **cached interpreter** (`core/src/arm/arm_ci*.c`) is the app's
default CPU backend (Settings → Diagnostics → CPU Execution Backend offers
Standard for comparison) and an opt-in backend on every other host
(`bootkernel --cpu-backend cached`).
It predecodes guest code into blocks of specialised handlers, runs anything
uncommon through the reference interpreter's own code, keeps device time
exact, and generates no host code. On compiled ARMv6 workloads it measured
2.56× the reference on a desktop x86-64 host, 2.50× with MSVC and 2.94× on
Apple Silicon CI runners, with identical final machine state on every run; a
differential fuzzer and the workload suite check it on every push. On an
iPhone 17 Pro Max (build bc45a3f, CPU graphics, one full boot each) it ran
208.6 M guest instructions per busy second against Standard's 114.7 M. Two
boots on it, one per graphics mode, were still running when their reports
were taken (6.0 and 6.2 G instructions in, no CPU stop). A
bit-for-bit comparison with the reference over a full boot has not been run,
so the desktop tools keep the reference interpreter as their default. Details:
[`docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`](docs/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md),
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md),
[`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

## Build & run

Building the app needs no local Apple SDK or toolchain — CI does the
Apple-specific build. Booting Apple software needs firmware you supply yourself.

**Test the core locally** (any OS with a C compiler and CMake):
```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

The public suite runs without Apple firmware; extra symbol and driver checks
switch on only if you supply a kernelcache. Test counts move as coverage grows,
so trust the current output and CI logs, not a number copied into this file.
`Release` is the default on purpose: the interpreter is the hot loop here. Add
`-DS5LBOX_JIT=ON` in a separate build directory to compile the (inactive)
translator and run its tests.

**Boot the kernel** once you have supplied firmware. The recommended path leaves
your firmware untouched and needs a work path that does not already exist:
```sh
mkdir -p work
build/core/bootkernel firmware/kernel.macho \
    -d firmware/devicetree.bin \
    -c "debug=0x8 serial=1 nand-enable-adm=0" \
    --external-md firmware/rootfs.img work/rootfs-7e18-run01.img \
    -R 128 \
    -n 420000000
```

`--external-md` accepts only these exact inputs, checked by size and hash before
anything is opened:

| Accepted input | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| `firmware/kernel.macho` | 7,942,144 | `0d8cdb339d37cf37a1db2638fff79272ecd63a17764bf7666efa1618725df70c` |
| `firmware/devicetree.bin` | 40,544 | `4867c95fedf544bda2ecaa2626ae14c01a60d7771dc53ffe6fd3a6aac8b8ba57` |
| `firmware/rootfs.img` | 433,274,880 | `c3251e7f092c939d5818e92086cb47680981cfb03731de7b55d238c942eb5e82` |

It then creates a writable work image — exactly 466,825,216 bytes (445.199 MiB)
at the default growth, up to the external bridge's 2 GiB volume ceiling with
larger `--grow` values — and serves the guest's disk from it. Budget at least
500 MiB for the default image or slightly over 2 GiB for the maximum, plus room
for logs; the parent directory must exist. External-media checkpoints carry
same-name `.mdimage` and `.mdstate` sidecars and may be restored or chained.
Any guest storage error, undefined instruction, kernel panic
or halt exits nonzero; the work image is deliberately kept afterwards and the
next run refuses to reuse that path, so archive it or pick a new filename. A
cleanup warning means a second large temporary may also be left behind.

Your kernel, device tree and root filesystem stay byte-for-byte unchanged: the
five firmware patches touch only the loaded kernel copy, device-tree edits only
the in-memory copy, and filesystem changes only the work image — where the
guest's `/private/etc/fstab` is repointed at the emulator's fake disk and the
volume is **grown** by `--grow` MB, default 32. Both are required, for reasons and
numbers given in [`docs/BOOTLOG.md`](docs/BOOTLOG.md).

Other flags: `nand-enable-adm=0` stops a flash-controller driver panicking on
unmodelled hardware; three workarounds are automatic and printed in the run
header (the real-time-clock wait patch, and hiding the MBX graphics and SHA-1
accelerator nodes); `-g` and `-S` switch those two known-broken paths back on for
diagnostics; `--external-md` rejects `-K`, which would disable its kernel patch
set. The older mode that loads the root filesystem into guest RAM
(`-r firmware/rootfs.img -R 512`) remains for checkpoint replay and alone accepts
`--keep-fstab`, which reproduces the original `launchd` halt; its `-R 512` is a
hard limit imposed by the kernel and the modelled memory map, not a preference,
so historical 768 MiB experiments are not valid recipes.

### The tools

| | |
|---|---|
| `bootkernel` | boots the kernel and reports where it stopped: progress checkpoints, a sampled profile, every hardware page touched and what touched it, fault sites, and the guest's console output |
| `bootkernel --external-md <source> <new-work>` | the gated cold-boot path above: verify the firmware, create a writable work image, and serve the guest's disk from the host instead of pinning ~445 MiB inside guest RAM |
| `bootkernel -L` | print the map of drivers built into the kernel and exit without booting |
| `bootkernel --snapshot-at <insn> <file>` / `--restore <file>` | save and resume the running machine. Unreachable, missed, malformed or incompatible checkpoint requests fail loudly instead of silently producing nothing |
| `snapboot` | the snapshot acceptance harness — it also prints a report derived from the live machine, because comparing two snapshot files alone lets a field the format never stores cancel out on both sides |
| `machoinfo <kernel> -k` / `-r <addr>` | dump the driver map, or resolve one address to a kernel symbol |
| `img3dump`, `unlzss`, `runfw` | firmware container, decompression, and bare-payload tools |

[`docs/debugging.md`](docs/debugging.md) is the procedure these add up to.

**Get the app:** on a matching push or manual dispatch, the `ios-build` workflow
produces an ad-hoc-signed `NEON.ipa` as a temporary GitHub Actions artifact.
CI has no Apple signing identity, so that artifact **will not install on stock
iOS as-is**. Re-sign it with your own ordinary provisioning profile using your
preferred stock-device installation method. The app requests no private, JIT,
debug, increased-memory or jailbreak entitlement and needs only the normal app
sandbox. A jailbroken development phone makes testing easier; it is not a
product dependency.

**Supply firmware:** for the desktop harness, put your **own** iPhone OS 3.1.3
files and keys in the git-ignored `firmware/` directory; see
[`docs/BOOT_CHAIN.md`](docs/BOOT_CHAIN.md). In the iOS app, open Settings from
the machine list and choose **Import from an IPSW**. The importer reads an IPSW
you already possess, asks only for keys absent from that archive, and validates
the three produced artefacts. Nothing is downloaded, no key list is bundled,
and no Apple firmware is committed or shipped.

For a controlled graphics comparison, choose **Graphics for new machines** in
Settings *before* opening a newly created machine for the first time. **CPU
software** is the accepted default; **Experimental MBX** pairs MBX-on with the
CPU-renderer override off. That choice is written into the machine's writable
image when it is prepared. Changing the setting afterwards does not convert an
existing machine: the boot-time MBX switch can move, but the image-time renderer
value cannot. Results from such a hybrid do not test the newly selected mode.

## Requirements

- **Host: a modern iPhone. A jailbreak is NOT required.** Corrected
  2026-07-29 against a measurement rather than an assumption: the app has been
  run on a **stock iPhone 17 (iPhone17,2) on iOS 26.1**, which reports
  `CS_DEBUGGED : no` in its own on-device self-test and boots the guest kernel
  anyway. This project was developed against a jailbroken iPhone 6s Plus (A9,
  iOS 15), and the README stated that as a requirement when it was only the
  first host it happened to run on.

  It asks nothing special of the host because it is a pure **interpreter**. Its
  tracked entitlement dictionary is deliberately empty. No
  generated code is executed, so nothing has to be made writable-then-executable
  and no debug entitlement is needed. That changes if the code translator is
  ever finished: JIT execution needs both an executable mapping and a process
  the kernel will let run it, which is exactly what `CS_DEBUGGED : no` denies.
  The self-test already reports `JIT execute : not run at startup (capability
  preflight failed)` on that stock device, and the translator stays off unless
  an opt-in on-device check confirms generated code really can run.

  NOT established: which iOS versions or devices this works on in general. Two
  hosts are two data points, not a compatibility matrix.
- **Firmware:** your own iPhone OS 3.1.3 image and keys. **No Apple firmware
  image or decryption key is bundled.**
