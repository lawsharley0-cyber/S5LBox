/*
 * S5LBox — turning a user's own IPSW into the three files the emulator accepts.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. Until now the app's Firmware section listed three file
 * names and asked the user to produce them by hand, which in practice meant
 * following docs/BOOT_CHAIN.md on a desktop with five command-line tools. This
 * does the parts of that a program can do: open the archive, read Apple's own
 * manifest to learn which member is which, unwrap the IMG3 containers,
 * decompress the kernel, expand the root filesystem's partition, hash
 * everything and say what came out.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO, STATED FIRST BECAUSE IT IS THE WHOLE SHAPE OF THIS FILE.
 * Every payload in a 3.x IPSW is AES-encrypted, and the keys are NOT in the
 * IPSW. They are not derivable from it either -- they were recovered from the
 * hardware by researchers and published per build and per device. Measured on
 * the real 7E18 iPhone1,2 archive: the kernelcache, the device tree, iBoot and
 * every boot image carry a KBAG with cryptState 1 and 128-bit keys, and the
 * key/IV stored in that KBAG do not decrypt the payload -- they are wrapped, so
 * decrypting with them produces noise rather than "complzss".
 *
 * So this code:
 *   - ships no keys, embeds no key table, and performs no network access;
 *   - accepts keys the USER supplies, and labels them that way everywhere;
 *   - when a key is absent, says exactly which artefact needs one and what kind
 *     it is, rather than failing vaguely or hanging.
 *
 * A user with no keys still gets: the archive opened, the device and build
 * identified from Restore.plist, every member located, each container parsed,
 * and a precise list of what remains. A user with keys gets the three files,
 * verified byte-for-byte against known-good hashes when the build is one we
 * have hashes for.
 *
 * WHY IT IS PLAIN C. Same reason as VMTouchMap, VMOptions, VMTouchQueue,
 * VMInstances and VMButtonQueue: this is where silent wrongness lives, every
 * length in it comes from a file off the internet, and a host CI runner can
 * test it. No UIKit, no Foundation. The Objective-C shell is a caller.
