#pragma mark - Which guest is running

/*
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY EXECUTING, and why it is not the other thing.
 *
 * These exist because the app used to tell every user, on its first screen,
 * that machines run a built-in test program — which stopped being true the day
 * bring-up landed, and would have gone on being displayed. Every claim the UI
 * makes about the guest now comes from here, and every one of these is set
 * from what the engine did rather than from what it was asked to do.
 *
 * -modeDescription:  a short label for the running guest, or nil before a
 *                    machine exists. "built-in test guest", or a description
 *                    of the firmware, e.g. "iPhone OS 3.1.3 kernel, root on
 *                    /dev/md0".
 * -isRunningFirmware: NO unless Apple's kernel is what was installed. There is
 *                    no path that makes this YES without bring-up succeeding.
 * -bringUpNote:      why the firmware path was not taken, when there was
 *                    firmware to take it with, or what the app is doing about
 *                    it. nil when there is nothing to explain — which includes
 *                    the ordinary case of no firmware having been imported.
 *                    THIS MUST REACH THE USER: a failed bring-up that only
 *                    logs to the console is invisible outside developer mode.
 *                    A SUCCESSFUL boot can set it too, and that is not a
 *                    contradiction: most of the settings switches never reach
 *                    the request, and a machine running with a configuration
 *                    the settings screen does not show is exactly the thing
 *                    this pair of methods exists to stop being invisible. Read
 *                    -isRunningFirmware to title it, never the presence of a
 *                    note.

 *                    on its own thread. The machine runs the test guest
