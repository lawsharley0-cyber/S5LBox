//  S5LBox — the emulator run loop. See VMEngine.h.
//
//  THREADING
//
//  One thread owns the machine for its whole lifetime: it allocates it, steps
//  it, and frees it. Nothing else calls into core/ at all. Every few tens of
//  milliseconds that thread takes a mutex and publishes a snapshot — a copy of
//  the guest's framebuffer, whatever the guest printed to the UART, and a
//  couple of counters. The UI takes the same mutex and copies the snapshot out.
//  The lock is therefore held only for two memcpys of a 600 KB buffer, never
//  across interpretation, so the main thread cannot be blocked behind guest
//  execution no matter how slow the guest is.
//
//  MEMORY
//
//  Guest DRAM is 128 MB, matching the hardware. On a 2 GB device that sounds
//  alarming and is not, for one specific reason: core's s5l8900_init() gets it
//  from calloc(), and a request that size goes straight to mmap'd anonymous
//  memory that the kernel fills with zeroes lazily, one page at a time, on
//  first touch. Untouched guest RAM is address space, not footprint. This demo
//  guest touches its one code page and the 600 KB framebuffer, so the resident
//  cost is well under a megabyte of the 128.
//
//  That is a claim about the allocator, not a measurement, so the app measures
//  it: physFootprintBytes reads phys_footprint from TASK_VM_INFO, which is the
//  exact counter jetsam compares against the per-process limit, and the app
//  prints the before/after delta on screen. Do not trust the paragraph above
//  over the number on the phone.

#pragma mark - Choosing a guest

/*
 * THE ONE DECISION: Apple's kernel, or the built-in test guest.
 *
 * Called on the starting thread with the machine already allocated and nothing
 * else touching it. All the real work is in app/Sources/VMFirmwareBoot.c, which
 * is plain C and is tested by core/tests -- this method is only the policy of
 * WHEN to try, and what to say when it does not work.
 *
 * THE RULES IT ENFORCES, in order of how badly getting them wrong would hurt:
 *
 *  1. The firmware path is taken only when vm_firmware_boot_start() returns
 *     true. There is no other assignment of a firmware string to _mode.
 *  2. A firmware failure is NEVER silent. _bringUpNote gets the reason,
 *     -statusLine carries it, and the console gets the full detail. The demo
 *     guest then runs, and _mode says it is the demo guest.
 *  3. A failed bring-up may have written megabytes of kernel into DRAM, so the
 *     machine is torn down and rebuilt before the demo guest is installed
 *     rather than layered on top of a half-loaded kernel.
 *
 * WHERE IT LOOKS. Two directories, not one, and the split is what makes two
 * machines two machines: the three imported artefacts are shared and read-only
 * (Documents/firmware, where VMFirmwareImporter writes), and the writable work
 * image belongs to THIS machine alone (Machines/<id>). VMInstancePaths.c owns
 * that derivation, including what happens to the single shared work image an
 * older build left behind. An engine with no instance id refuses the firmware
 * path outright rather than guessing at a directory -- see -resolveFilesInto:.

/*
 * A WEDGED GUEST AND A BUSY ONE LOOK IDENTICAL FROM OUTSIDE. Instructions
 * retire, the rate looks healthy, and nothing is printed. The difference is
 * WHERE the instructions go, and on a phone there is no debugger to ask.
 *
 * So the emulator thread asks the machine itself, between chunks, at a point
 * where nothing is executing and no lock is held: one PC per chunk, binned
 * into 64-byte regions.
 *
 * Sampling once per 100,000 instructions sounds far too sparse to find a
 * loop, and for a profile it would be. For THIS question it is exactly right:
 * a spin loop executes its handful of instructions billions of times, so
 * every single sample lands inside it. Sparseness is not a weakness here, it
 * is what makes the signal unambiguous -- a region that takes almost a whole
 * window is not "hot", it is the only thing running.
 *
 * Diagnostics only, in the sense this project means it: it never stops the
 * guest, never writes guest state, never changes what executes, and cannot
 * manufacture a result. It reports where the machine already was.
 *
 * Addresses are printed raw rather than symbolised. Carrying a symbol table
 * for an 8 MB kernel on the device costs memory on the one machine that has
 * least of it, and resolving four numbers against ksyms afterwards costs
 * nothing.
