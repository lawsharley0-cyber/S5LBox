//
//  S5LBox — the app's settings, and an honest account of which of them do
//  anything.
//
//  Two kinds of value live here and they are deliberately kept apart:
//
//  THE OPTION ROWS, which mirror bootkernel's BOOT_TOGGLES through VMOptions.c.
//  This class only STORES them. What each one does to a real bring-up — reach
//  the request, get written into the work image, or reach nothing at all — is
//  decided in app/Sources/VMBootOptions.c and is different per row. That used
//  to be one sentence here saying none of them did anything, which stopped
//  being true the day the app booted firmware; it is a tested table now
//  precisely so it cannot go stale again.
//
//  APPLIED HERE. The instruction cap and the pause-on-background switch. Both
//  are real properties of this app's run loop and both take effect immediately.
//
//  NEW-MACHINE DEFAULTS live in NSUserDefaults. A machine created by the
//  current app records the two image-time graphics values at its first open,
//  and the launch path temporarily overlays those two rows while that machine
//  starts.
//  Older machines have no trustworthy record: their historical option bits
//  were compile-time defaults rather than what prepared the image, so they
//  deliberately retain the app-wide behaviour instead of being guessed at.
//
//  Firmware paths are a third case: reported, not stored. The app ships no
//  firmware and downloads none, so all this class does is name the directory it
//  would read and say whether a file is there. Putting files in that directory
//  is VMFirmwareImporter's job, from an IPSW the user already has.
