//
//  S5LBox — the machine list, on disk.
//
//  VMInstances.c owns the list and everything that can be wrong about it; this
//  is the thin Objective-C layer that gives it a file and a place to live. It
//  holds no rules of its own: every validation, every refusal and the entire
//  persisted format come from the C, which is where they can be tested without
//  a device.
//
//  WRITES ARE ATOMIC, and that is the whole reason this class exists rather
//  than a couple of calls in a view controller. The list is written to a
//  temporary file and then renamed over the real one, so a process killed
//  mid-save leaves the previous list intact rather than a truncated file. The
//  parser refuses a truncated file outright — it will not return half a list —
//  which turns "killed while saving" into "lost the last change" instead of
//  "lost every machine".
