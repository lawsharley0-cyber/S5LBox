/*
 * Host-side tests for app/Sources/VMBootOptions.c — the join between the
 * settings screen's sixteen switches and the bring-up request.
 *
 * The property being defended is not "the right switches work". It is that the
 * app cannot show a switch in one position while the machine honours the
 * other WITHOUT SAYING SO. Every one of those facts is asserted here longhand,
 * so that a change to either side is a deliberate edit to a test rather than a
 * UI that silently starts lying again.
 *
 * The counts in this comment used to be "two rows reach the request; twelve do
 * not; six are already in conflict on an untouched installation", and they
 * were accurate when written. They are not the shape of the thing any more:
 * nine rows now reach bring-up or a runtime service (two opt-outs, six nubs,
 * and NAT), three are written into the work image when it is made, and four
 * remain fixed. Exactly one -- "nat" -- conflicts with the settings-time
 * prediction at its defaults before the actual work-image record is read. The
 * live numbers are asserted below; this paragraph is prose and must never be
 * the thing anyone trusts.
