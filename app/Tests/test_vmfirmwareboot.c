/*
 * S5LBox — the app's firmware boot path (app/Sources/VMFirmwareBoot.c).
 *
 * The property being defended is not "can it boot": that is what
 * core/tests/test_bringup.c measures, against the real kernel. It is that the
 * app can never tell a user it is running Apple's firmware when it is not.
 *
 * So the cases here are the ones where something is absent, empty, or wrong,
 * and each asserts two things: that the answer is a refusal, and that the
 * refusal names the file. A silent fallback and a wrong claim are the same bug
 * from the user's side, and this is the only place either can be caught before
 * a phone is involved.
 *
 * Needs no firmware, deliberately: every fixture here is a file this test
 * writes itself.
