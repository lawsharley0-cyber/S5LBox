/*
 * The replacement.  PROVENANCE: this is Apple's own plist above with ONE
 * addition -- an EnvironmentVariables dictionary containing CA_ENABLE_MBX2D=0
 * -- and it is deliberately the same 1490 bytes.  Parsed with a property-list
 * reader the two differ by exactly that one key: every other key, value and
 * nesting level is identical, and the DOCTYPE is kept.
 *
 * The indentation is NOT the stock indentation, and that is the whole trick.
 * The new dictionary costs 100 bytes, so all 122 leading tabs were removed and
 * 29 of them re-added, one per line, from the DOCTYPE down.  XML treats
 * inter-element whitespace as insignificant, so this changes nothing a parser
 * sees while making the file byte-for-byte the length of the record it
 * replaces -- which is what lets logicalSize, totalBlocks and the file's single
 * extent stay exactly as they are.  Do not "tidy" this back up: any edit that
 * changes the length turns a safe overwrite into HFS+ catalog surgery, and the
 * length gate below will refuse to build rather than let that happen quietly.
 *
 * What it configures is Apple's switch, not ours.  CA::WindowServer::
 * MBXServer::MBXServer (0x31241d78 in this build's QuartzCore) reads
 * CA_ENABLE_MBX2D with getenv(), falls back to LK_ENABLE_MBX2D, and treats
 * "absent" as ENABLED; the only reader of that flag, MBXServer::mbx2d_context()
 * at 0x31241a8c, returns NULL early when it is 0, and both of its callers then
 * take CA::WindowServer::Server's software path (sw_renderer -> _CARenderOGLNew
 * -> CA::OGL::SWContext).  With the flag left at its default, MBX2D talks to a
 * PowerVR kext that never started -- this VM un-matches arm-io/mbx -- and
 * _mbx2DDisable+0x20 stores through a NULL global context, which is the
 * KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at 0x00000048 that kills SpringBoard and leaves
 * launchd respawning it forever.  launchd honours the key: /sbin/launchd's key
 * table carries EnvironmentVariables and UserEnvironmentVariables next to
 * ThrottleInterval and MachServices, and it imports _setenv.

 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS THE ONE.  The image ships no PPP launchd job at all, and
 * this provisioner cannot split a catalog B-tree node, so creating a file at a
 * path that says what it is was not on the table.  What was on the table is
 * that several shipped plists name binaries this image does not contain, which
 * makes overwriting one of them size-neutral with no collateral damage
 * whatsoever.  Four were surveyed: chud.pilotfish (530 B, points at
 * /Developer/usr/libexec/pilotfish), chud.chum (515 B), graphicsservices.sample
 * (447 B) and tcpdump.server (433 B).  /Developer, /usr/local and
 * /usr/libexec/tcpdumpserver are all absent, so all four are inert -- but a
 * fully-argumented pppd job is 515 bytes, so only the largest of them has the
 * budget, and an earlier revision of the plan that named tcpdump.server was
 * simply wrong about the arithmetic.
 *
 * Note the DOCTYPE says "Apple Inc.", where the SpringBoard plist above says
 * "Apple".  Both are byte-exact transcriptions of what the image contains; the
 * two files were produced by different Apple toolchains and normalising them
 * to each other would break the pattern match.
 *
 * This is a HIJACK, and docs/networking.md says in as many words that PPP over
 * an emulated UART is a temporary workaround pending real drivers and
 * controllers.  It should be replaced by a job at an honest path the day this
 * provisioner can create one.

/*
 * The replacement: a launchd job that runs the guest's own signed
 * /usr/sbin/pppd against uart4, at exactly the same 530 bytes.
 *
 * EVERY ARGUMENT IS THERE FOR A STATED REASON.  This is Apple pppd 2.4.2,
 * armv6, 284,608 bytes, with its tty channel intact (_tty_channel,
 * _set_up_tty, _connect_tty, _tty_establish_ppp, _options_for_tty are all
 * present as symbols).  The tty channel is pppd's DEFAULT channel and the
 * string "PPPSerial" does not appear in the binary, so no link plugin is
 * involved -- which matters, because PPPSerial.ppp does not ship either.
 *
 *   /dev/tty.debug   NOT /dev/uart.debug, and run78 is why.
 *
 *                    AppleOnboardSerialBSDClient names its devfs node after
 *                    the device tree child, and uart4's child is `debug`, so
 *                    /dev/uart.debug is the node that exists -- CommCenter's
 *                    own strings carry it and /dev/uart.umts verbatim.  It
 *                    opens, and tcgetattr and tcsetattr both work on it.  It
 *                    is still the wrong node, because it is not a tty:
 *                    AppleOnboardSerialBSDClient::start registers its cdevsw
 *                    (0xc0478060) with d_ttys = NULL and d_type = 0 rather
 *                    than D_TTY, and the ioctl switch at 0xc046fd52 handles
 *                    TIOCGETA and TIOCSETA* but has no arm for TIOCSETD or
 *                    TIOCSCTTY -- both fall to `movs r0,#0x19` at 0xc046fe30,
 *                    which is ENOTTY.  That is exactly what run78's console
 *                    printed, twice.
 *
 *                    The path cannot reach ttioctl at all, so linesw[PPPDISC]
 *                    is never consulted: _ttioctl's Thumb pointer 0xc01368a9
 *                    occurs EXACTLY ONCE in the whole 7.9 MB kernelcache, at
 *                    0xc0469430 inside IOSerialFamily, and AppleOnboardSerial
 *                    never references it.
 *
 *                    IOSerialBSDClient is the kext that publishes tty nodes
 *                    (its name templates are at 0xc046b164 / 0xc046b158), and
 *                    AppleOnboardSerialSync's metaclass names a superclass at
 *                    0xc046d280 inside IOSerialFamily's image, so a
 *                    /dev/tty.debug MAY also be published.  That is not
 *                    proven, and this argument is the experiment: pppd probes
 *                    it for free.  A node that does not exist makes
 *                    setdevname() return 0, and tty_process_extra_options+0x68
 *                    (0x00021628) prints "no device specified and stdin is not
 *                    a tty" and exits TWO, which is distinguishable from every
 *                    other failure this job has produced.
 *
 *                    If it is absent, the fallback is `notty`: get_pty
 *                    (0x0001bd70) hands pppd a pty slave, which is a real BSD
 *                    tty where TIOCSETD applies, and pppd then shuttles bytes
 *                    over stdin/stdout, which the raw cdev does support.  That
 *                    costs a StandardInPath key and puts pppd's log on the
 *                    same line as its frames, so it is second choice.
 *   local            do not use modem control lines.  pppd watches for carrier
 *                    by default, and this UART has no DCD to raise.
 *   nocrtscts        do not ask for hardware flow control.  uart4 carries
 *                    `no-flow-control`, so the driver short-circuits
 *                    getFlowStatus to "asserted" without reading UMSTAT; the
 *                    flag keeps pppd's request consistent with that.
 *   nodetach         MANDATORY under launchd.  pppd daemonises by default, and
 *                    a job whose first process exits immediately is a job
 *                    launchd believes has died.
 *
 * StandardOutPath = /dev/console IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE IN THIS FILE,
 * and it is here because of a measurement rather than a preference.
 *
 * IT WAS StandardErrorPath UNTIL 5944b5f READ THE BINARY, and that is why
 * run75 came back with a console byte-identical to run74's.  pppd's error()
 * and fatal() both reach one emitter at 0x0002245c, which syslog()s the
 * message and then writes it to `*log_to_fd`.  `_log_to_fd` lives at
 * 0x00039c70 with a file image of ONE -- stdout -- and `nodetach` means
 * nothing ever lowers it.  File descriptor 2 is never written to at all, so
 * the previous key pointed launchd at a stream pppd does not use, and
 * /dev/null still consumed the only message that could name the failure.
 *
 * The rename frees exactly TWO bytes -- the key name occurs once per line,
 * inside <key>...</key>, not once per tag -- and those two go back into the
 * filler so the record is still exactly 530.  The four dict-level <key>s keep
 * their single leading tab and the <array>/</array> pair gains one each.  XML
 * treats inter-element whitespace as insignificant, so a property-list reader
 * still sees four keys and a five-argument job.
 *
 * run74 established that this job already works as far as the exec: launchd
 * posix_spawned /usr/sbin/pppd at instruction 557,124,470 as pid 19, pppd ran
 * for 182 million instructions, and then called exit(1) at 739,184,188
 * (_exit1 status 0x100).  ONE is pppd 2.4.2's EXIT_FATAL_ERROR, which is
 * already informative: it is NOT EXIT_OPTION_ERROR (2), NOT EXIT_NOT_ROOT (3),
 * NOT EXIT_NO_KERNEL_SUPPORT (4) and NOT EXIT_OPEN_FAILED (7), so the device
 * node was not the problem and the command line parsed.  It is a fatal() call,
 * and fatal() writes its message to stderr.  Without this key launchd gives
 * the job /dev/null and that message is destroyed -- which is exactly the
 * state run74 was read in, and why it could only report an exit code.
 * `StandardErrorPath` is confirmed present in the image (5 occurrences of the
 * key name; /dev/console appears 7 times).
 *
 * TWO ARGUMENTS WERE SPENT TO BUY IT, and the trade is stated rather than
 * quietly made.  The key and its value cost 61 bytes and the budget had 15.
 *
 *   `noauth` was dropped.  pppd 2.4.2 only sets auth_required when a default
 *   route already exists, and at this point in the boot there is none, so it
 *   was determinism rather than necessity from the start.
 *
 *   The explicit `115200` was dropped, and this one is a real trade.  With no
 *   speed on the command line, set_up_tty() reads the port's current one back
 *   and calls fatal("Baud rate for %s is 0; need explicit baud rate") if it
 *   reads zero.  That risk is now bounded rather than blind: AppleOnboardSerial
 *   programs a default of 19200 8N1 at 0xc047244a during start(), before any
 *   tty is opened, and that is the only baud constant in either serial kext.
 *   And the trade is self-resolving -- if the readback IS zero, that fatal()
 *   is now the message that appears on the console, which is more than the
 *   previous configuration could tell us.  Putting the speed back is a
 *   one-line change once the console says what pppd is actually complaining
 *   about.
 *
 * MachServices is dropped deliberately.  With no Mach port to hold there is no
 * on-demand path, so RunAtLoad is the whole lifecycle; keeping the port would
 * register a service for a binary that no longer exists.  The Label is kept
 * byte-identical so the console messages launchd prints about this job remain
 * greppable against the name the file already had, and so the label cannot
 * disagree with the filename.
 *
 * A MISSING /etc/ppp/options IS NOT FATAL -- pppd warns and continues on its
 * built-in defaults plus argv -- which is what makes a standalone invocation
 * viable at all, since this provisioner cannot create that file either.
 *
 * THE INDENTATION IS FILLER, exactly as it is in CA_PLIST_SOFTWARE_RENDER, and
 * for the same reason.  The job's own bytes come to 526; the budget is 530; so
 * there are exactly FOUR leading tabs, one on each dict-level <key>.  XML
 * treats inter-element whitespace as insignificant, so a property-list reader
 * sees exactly the four keys and the five-argument job above and nothing else.
 * Do not reformat this: the length gate below is a compile error, not a
 * comment.

/*
 * THE SANDBOX FALLBACK, and it exists because a real device said no.
 *
 * open_directory_walk() opens every component starting at "/", which is what
 * makes its no-symlink guarantee checkable. On iOS an app may not open the
 * container directories on the way to its OWN Documents folder -- not even to
 * search them -- so the walk dies with EPERM several components above anything
 * the app owns. ROOTFS_WORK_TRAVERSE (O_SEARCH) was supposed to settle that and
 * does not: measured on an iPhone 6s Plus, importing firmware into
 * Documents/firmware still failed with "cannot open source directory:
 * Operation not permitted (errno 1)".
 *
 * A sandboxed process CAN open the full path in one call -- the sandbox
 * evaluates the destination, not every ancestor. So on a refusal that is
 * clearly the sandbox (EPERM/EACCES) rather than a malformed path, open the
 * directory directly and re-establish the property the walk provided:
 * realpath() resolves every symlink, so if the resolved path equals the
 * requested one, no component was a link. A path that does traverse a symlink
 * gets the same refusal it always did.
 *
 * Strictly a FALLBACK. The walk runs first and its verdict wins whenever it
 * reaches one, including "unsafe" -- hence the immediate return on *unsafe.

/* ======================= HFS+ catalog provisioning =======================
 *
 * Everything above this line is a size-neutral overwrite: the catalog never
 * changes, so nothing can go wrong in it.  This section is the opposite kind
 * of code -- it inserts records into the catalog B-tree that a guest kernel
 * will mount and trust -- so it is built around four rules.
 *
 * 1. PLAN, THEN COMMIT.  Every decision and every refusal happens while the
 *    work image is still untouched.  The plan is applied to an in-memory cache
 *    of the nodes, the bitmap and the volume header; not one byte reaches the
 *    file until the whole request has succeeded in memory.  A refusal
 *    therefore leaves the image byte-identical, and that is a property of the
 *    structure rather than of remembering to undo things.
 *
 * 2. ONE SPLIT, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN HAPPEN HERE.  The rule used to
 *    be "no splitting at all".  Exactly one case is now implemented, because
 *    exactly one case can arise from the way this provisioner is used: a batch
 *    of new CNIDs is created in ascending key order, so every key that does not
 *    fit is a key BEYOND the tree's current maximum, landing at the end of the
 *    LAST leaf.  catalog_leaf_split_append() handles that and nothing else.
 *
 *    A full leaf's split has to be recorded in the index node above it, and
 *    THAT node can be full too -- on the shipping 7E18 catalog it very nearly
 *    is, with 16 free bytes against 127 children, room for exactly one more
 *    leaf.  So catalog_level_extend() is written once and used at every level:
 *    the operation "chain a new node on to the right-hand end of this level and
 *    tell the level above" is identical for a leaf and for an index node, and
 *    it recurses upwards until some level has room.  It is still append-only at
 *    every level, and it still moves no existing record.
 *
 *    Everything else still refuses, by the same names as before.  An interior
 *    insert into a full leaf is ROOTFS_WORK_PROVISION_NODE_FULL -- unchanged,
 *    including its message.  A record that would become a leaf's FIRST key in a
 *    tree with index nodes is ROOTFS_WORK_PROVISION_LEAF_HEAD, because the
 *    ancestors' index keys would have to be rewritten.  A rightmost append that
 *    runs out of levels -- a full ROOT, or a root leaf with no index level
 *    above it at all -- is ROOTFS_WORK_PROVISION_SPLIT_UNSUPPORTED, because
 *    growing a new root changes treeDepth and rootNode and that is not
 *    implemented; an exhausted node map is ROOTFS_WORK_PROVISION_BTREE_FULL.
 *    A half-implemented interior split that silently corrupted the tree would
 *    be far worse than any of those refusals.
 *
 *    What the implemented split touches is still a short, enumerable list, and
 *    catalog_audit() below checks every item on it: the old node's fLink, the
 *    new node's bLink/fLink, the B-tree header's lastLeafNode, freeNodes and
 *    the node-allocation map in the header node's third record, and one
 *    appended record in the parent index node.  The new node receives the
 *    single record being inserted and the old node is left exactly as it was,
 *    which is both the cheapest split for ascending appends and the one with
 *    the least to get wrong.  treeDepth, rootNode, firstLeafNode and totalNodes
 *    are never written.
 *
 * 3. A SEARCH THAT CANNOT LOOK MUST SAY SO.  tools/hfsx_extract.py starts its
 *    walk at the B-tree header's firstLeafNode, and on an image where that
 *    field was stale it reported "not found" for every file that was actually
 *    there.  Absence and inability are different answers.  Here, lookups
 *    descend from rootNode with full structural validation at every step and
 *    return ROOTFS_WORK_PROVISION_CATALOG_CORRUPT -- never "missing" -- for
 *    anything unexpected; and catalog_audit() below independently walks the
 *    whole leaf chain, checks it against the header's own firstLeafNode,
 *    lastLeafNode and leafRecords, and requires globally ascending keys.  It
 *    runs once before the plan, so a broken tree is refused rather than
 *    written into, and once after the commit, so what was written is verified
 *    by a reader that shares no state with the writer.
 *
 * 4. THE ORDERING IS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED.  The stock rootfs ships with
 *    freeBlocks = 0.  This runs after grow_volume and re-reads the volume
 *    header itself, so "there is somewhere to put it" is a measurement of the
 *    image in front of it.
 *
 * Key ordering is HFSX binary compare (keyCompareType 0xBC), which is what the
 * shipping image uses.  Case-folding order (0xCF, and every HFS+ volume) needs
 * Apple's fold table to place a name correctly among existing ones, so it is
 * refused rather than approximated.

/*
 * THE GENERAL SPLIT.  `record` belongs at `position` in `node`, which is full,
 * and the rightmost append above does not apply -- either the record lands
 * inside the node rather than past its end, or the node is not the last one at
 * its level.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.  A batch of catalog entries is NOT one ascending run, even
 * when the caller's paths are sorted.  Creating file f under folder P writes
 * two records: the name key (P, f) and the thread key (cnid(f), ""), and every
 * cnid handed out is larger than P.  So the second file under P has to go
 * BETWEEN the first file's name record and the first file's thread record --
 * an interior insert -- and once that stretch of the tree has filled one leaf,
 * a rightmost append is not the operation the tree needs.  That is why 64
 * entries fitted and a 644-entry payload could not.
 *
 * The node's records plus the new one are redistributed over `node` and one
 * fresh node chained immediately after it, as evenly by bytes as the record
 * boundaries allow.  Records DO move here, which is the whole difference from
 * catalog_level_extend() above; that routine is still preferred wherever it
 * applies, so an ascending run still splits without moving anything.
 * Exhaustively, what changes:
 *
 *   old node   keeps records [0, split), fLink 0 -> new node
 *   new node   records [split, end), bLink = old node, fLink = old fLink
 *   following  bLink -> new node, when the old node had a successor
 *   parent     one index record -> new node, at the old node's position + 1
 *   header     lastLeafNode when the old node was the last leaf, freeNodes -= 1
 *
 * firstLeafNode, rootNode, treeDepth and totalNodes are still never touched:
 * splitting the ROOT is the one shape that would move them and it is refused by
 * name.  Every line above is re-read from the written image by catalog_audit(),
 * which holds each index level to the child sequence of the level below it.

/*
 * r203 measured what r198 could only assume, and the assumption above --
 * "there is no static file to provision" -- is what it refutes.
 *
 * usepeerdns works. The guest ASKS: r203 counted six IPCP DNS options
 * arriving, four answered Nak with 10.0.2.3 and two finally Acked, so DNS1 and
 * DNS2 both converged and negotiation ended with the guest holding our
 * resolver address. And it still sent zero UDP. Not a failed query -- no
 * attempt at all.
 *
 * The reason is one level down. /etc/resolv.conf on this image is a symlink,
 * twenty bytes, whose target reads exactly "/var/run/resolv.conf" -- and that
 * target is the only resolv.conf in the volume. Nothing creates the file the
 * symlink points at. A resolver with no nameserver fails locally and never
 * reaches a socket, which is precisely the signature: zero attempts rather
 * than zero answers.
 *
 * So the negotiated address never becomes resolver configuration. On a real
 * device configd bridges that gap; this image runs pppd without the
 * SystemConfiguration machinery that would. Provisioning the target directly
 * is the same shape as provisioning /etc/ppp/options -- a static file the
 * guest cannot write for itself, holding the address ppp.c already hands out.
 *
 * /private/var/run ships on the stock volume, so only the FILE is created.
 * Asking for the parent as well is what made the first /etc/ppp attempt refuse
 * the whole plan instead of one entry.
 *
 * r204 RAN THIS AND IT DID NOT WORK, and the entry is kept anyway. The file is
 * provisioned -- the per-entry provisioning dump added after this run prints
 *
 *     file 0644 /private/var/run/resolv.conf  <- nameserver 10.0.2.3
 *
 * and r204 reported no provisioning error -- and the guest still sent zero UDP
 * and zero DNS queries. So this is a real negative, not an unreadable one, and
 * it eliminates the last "the guest was never told a nameserver" explanation:
 * pppd asks (six IPCP DNS options in r203), the peer answers (two Acked, four
 * Naked with 10.0.2.3), and now the file the /etc symlink points at exists and
 * names the same address. Three separate places all say 10.0.2.3 and nothing
 * sends a packet.
 *
 * What that leaves is the CONSUMER. Safari resolves through CFNetwork into
 * mDNSResponder, and mDNSResponder on Darwin takes its servers from configd's
 * dynamic store rather than by reading resolv.conf -- the store is populated by
 * the SystemConfiguration PPP controller, which this image does not run: it
 * gets a bare pppd on uart4 instead. A resolver holding zero servers fails its
 * caller immediately without touching a socket, which is exactly the observed
 * signature of zero ATTEMPTS rather than zero answers.
 *
 * That is an explanation consistent with every measurement so far, and it is
 * NOT yet a demonstrated cause. The next diagnostic is a trace of what the
 * guest actually opens and what mDNSResponder is holding -- not a fourth
 * speculative file. Three fixes have now been aimed at layers that were already
 * correct (defaultroute, usepeerdns, this), each costing a ~35-minute run,
 * while the six-line IPCP counter in core/src/net/ppp.c is what actually
 * located the fault.
 *
 * The entry stays because it is correct and cheap: a resolver that DOES fall
 * back to the file will find the right address there, and removing it would
 * only put back an absence that had to be measured once already.

 * The stock image does not ship a SystemConfiguration preferences directory.
 * A directly launched pppd can create State: dictionaries, but it cannot
