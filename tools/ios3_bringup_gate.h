/*
 * S5LBox -- the iPhone OS 3.1.3 (7E18) kernel gate, as a bring-up hook.
 *
 * core/src/boot/bringup.c holds no firmware addresses by design (see the rule
 * stated in core/include/md_bridge.h). It asks a caller-supplied gate to
 * authorize and patch the kernel it has just loaded, and this is that gate for
 * the one build this project supports: a six-line adapter over
 * ios3_kernel_patch_apply(), plus the four SVC site addresses the memory-disk
 * bridges must watch.
 *
 * It exists as its own translation unit rather than as a copy inside each
 * frontend so the desktop test and the iOS app authorize a kernel through the
 * same code. Nothing here allocates, opens a file, or knows what a machine is.
