/*
 * Addresses come from the resolved shared-cache map already in this tree
 * (docs/BOOTLOG.md, tools/dscmap.py). They are absolute and un-slid: iPhone
 * OS 3's dyld shared cache maps at a fixed address in every process, which is
 * what makes PC interception viable at all and also why the address-space
 * check in ios3_hle_step() is not optional.
 *
 * A prologue invented from what a compiler "would" emit is not an identity
 * check, it is a guess that fails open the first time it is wrong. A site with
 * prologue_n == 0 refuses to arm.
 *
 * READ OUT OF THE CACHE on 2026-07-30, which is what these sites were waiting
 * for. Both addresses resolve to a symbol at `va is +0x0` -- an exact function
 * start, not an address that merely landed inside one:
 *
 *   python tools/hfsx_extract.py <work.img> dyld_shared_cache_armv6 <cache>
 *   python tools/dscmap.py <cache> 0x338f61b0 --count 10   -> _CGBlt_fillBytes
 *   python tools/dscmap.py <cache> 0x338f63e8 --count 10   -> _CGSFillDRAM8by1
 *
 * FOUR words each, not two: both functions open with the identical
 * `push {r4,r5,r6,r7,lr}; add r7,sp,#0xc`, so a two-word prologue would match
 * either site -- and a check that cannot tell two neighbouring functions apart
 * is not an identity check. They first differ at word three.

/*
 * CoreGraphics, the leaf fill. It is the sole caller of _CGSFillDRAM8by1 -- a
 * tight `stm fp!, {r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r8,sl}` loop moving 32 bytes per
 * instruction. Leaf, pure, explicit src/dst/length: the easiest thing here to
 * verify, and the reason it is first.
 *
 * THE CALL COUNT THAT MADE IT LOOK URGENT DOES NOT SURVIVE. run59's 61,289
 * calls were a whole cold boot; run168 measured the window that actually
 * decides frame rate -- 75 composites over 1.18 G instructions -- and counted
 * CGBlt_fillBytes just 43 times in it. So replacing this is NOT an fps win on
 * the evidence available, and these sites stay IOS3_HLE_OBSERVE. What the
 * recorded prologues buy is that they can now arm and COUNT, which turns a
 * dead site into instrumentation that can confirm or refute run168 at the
 * site itself rather than through a profiler bucket.

 * THE RASTERISER, which is where a frame that is not lockdownd's actually goes.
 *
 * The two sites above were chosen from a whole-boot call count and did not
 * survive being measured inside a frame. These three were chosen the other way
 * round: from r212/r213, which bucketed one home-screen swipe by 4K page and
 * attributed every sample to an address space. Three pages in SpringBoard's
 * space (ttbr0 0x0bf1b000) hold 39.8% of all user samples in that window --
 *
 *     19.6%   0x3122b000    sw_sample_nearest_BGRA8
 *     13.7%   0x3122d000    sw_scanline
 *      6.5%   0x311e2000    ogl_poly_scan
 *
 * -- and the profile named them before anything was known about who they
 * belonged to, which is the corroboration: the address-space scan independently
 * returned "SpringBoard" for a process already measured to be rasterising.
 *
 * This is the shape the header's opening paragraph describes. The MBX2D exists
 * so a real iPhone never runs these on its CPU; CA_ENABLE_MBX2D=0 forces the
 * software path this VM has no GPU for, and the interpreter then walks it one
 * guest instruction per pixel.
 *
 * THEY ENTERED AS OBSERVE, and the order-of-work rule in the header is the
 * reason. 39.8% of a profile is what a sampler attributes to three pages; it is
 * not the same number as "calls times cost", and the CGBlt sites are the
 * standing proof that those two can disagree by enough to reverse a decision.
 * r271/r273 subsequently supplied the site-level call counts, live callback
 * ABI, state and sampler targets needed for the bounded replacements below.
 * They are still opt-in behind `--hle`, and a real armed/disarmed framebuffer
 * oracle remains mandatory before their pixels can be accepted.
 *
 * The first three prologue words are IDENTICAL for all three of these AND for
 * _CGSFillDRAM8by1 above, because they are the same compiler's frame setup. The
 * gate is therefore five words deep, not three: the fourth word is where they
 * separate (a shift, a one-register vpush, and a five-register vpush).

 * C++ signature, demangled:

 *                           unsigned count, unsigned *out)
 *
 * `unit` is a TEXTURE UNIT INDEX, not a vertex index: the code computes
 * unit*8 and adds it to a vert pointer before reading +0x20/+0x24, so a vert
 * carries an ARRAY of (u,v) float pairs at +0x20 with an 8-byte stride. Args
 * 3, 6 and 7 are never read. This was the one thing that could not be guessed
 * from the signature and is why the shape looked wrong at first.
 *
 * SWTexture, from the four loads at entry:
 *   +0x00  uint8_t *base      pixel data

 *
 * ogl_poly_vert, only the fields this routine touches:
 *   +0x0c  float    w         perspective divisor
 *   +0x20  float[2] uv[unit]  texture coordinates, 8-byte stride
 *
 * Constants, read from the literal pool rather than assumed:
 *   0x3122b9c4 = 65536.0f     float -> 16.16 fixed point
 *   0x3122b9c8 = 1.0f         numerator of the reciprocal
 *
 * The whole routine, with u/v as 16.16 accumulators and w as a float:
 *
 *   u  = (int)(start->uv[unit][0] * 65536.0f);
 *   v  = (int)(start->uv[unit][1] * 65536.0f);
 *   du = (int)(delta->uv[unit][0] * 65536.0f);
 *   dv = (int)(delta->uv[unit][1] * 65536.0f);
 *   w  = start->w;  dw = delta->w;
 *   for (k = 0; k < count; k++) {
 *       float inv = 1.0f / w;
 *       int x = (int)((float)u * inv);
 *       int y = (int)((float)v * inv);
 *       x = x < 0 ? 0 : x;                  // bic rd, rn, rn asr #31
 *       y = y < 0 ? 0 : y;
 *       if (y >= max_y) y = max_y;          // movge, so CLAMPS AT max_y
 *       if (x >= max_x) x = max_x;          // and this one clamps too
 *       out[k] = *(uint32_t *)(base + pitch * (y >> 16) + ((x >> 16) << 2));
 *       u += du;  v += dv;  w += dw;
 *   }
 *
 * PERSPECTIVE-CORRECT, which is the part that must not be simplified away:
 * the divide is per pixel, not per span, so dropping it would drift on any
 * transformed layer. The clamps saturate AT the limit rather than one below
 * it, and the negative clamp is `bic rd, rn, rn asr #31`, which is
 * "0 if negative else unchanged" -- not an absolute value.
 *
 * The native transcription below now implements the MMU and fault gates from
 * contract items 4 and 5. Its remaining acceptance gate is item 6: a real
 * framebuffer diff against the same binary and checkpoint with `--hle` absent.
 * The rounding is float-to-int truncation on both axes, which C's cast gives
 * exactly, so there is no rounding mode to match.

/*
 * MBX2D, WHICH IS A BETTER PLACE TO STAND THAN THE RASTERISER.
 *
 * The three sites above are the software rasteriser, and they were chosen
 * because a profile said they were expensive. They are also the WRONG LAYER,
 * and sizing the remaining two said so: sw_sample_nearest_BGRA8 transcribed in
 * 64 instructions, but sw_scanline is multi-path with a dozen context fields,
 * and ogl_poly_scan is ~3 KB with six calls out and a literal pool in the
 * middle. Neither is a transcription. Continuing down that road means hand-
 * porting a float rasteriser and diffing it pixel by pixel.
 *
 * The rasteriser only runs at all because CA_ENABLE_MBX2D=0 forces it. A real
 * iPhone composites through MBX2D, and THAT interface is small: the whole 2D
 * API is a handful of state setters and two operations. Measured from the
 * cache's own symbol table -- mbx2DCtxSetSourceSurface is 5 instructions,
 * SetScissor 7, SetDestinationSurface 7, and the two blits dispatch through a
 * function pointer in the context. So the same technique applied one layer up
 * replaces ALL of the rasteriser rather than a fraction of it, and does so at
 * an interface with names and an argument shape instead of a register file.
 *
 * WHAT THE DECODE ESTABLISHED, all of it read rather than assumed:
 *
 *   mbx2DCtxBlitColor  ldr ip,[r0,#0x5c] ; bx ip   -> ctx->fill_dispatch
 *   mbx2DCtxBlitCopy   ldr ip,[r0,#0x60] ; bx ip   -> ctx->copy_dispatch
 *
 * Both are two-instruction thunks, and the global-context entry points
 * (mbx2DBlitColor, mbx2DBlitCopy) reach the work by calling them, so one site
 * on each thunk catches every caller of either form. The dispatch targets are
 * installed by generateProfile() and on EVT2 they route into the 3D core --
 * mbx3DCtxBlitCopy alone is 890 instructions -- which is the size of what
 * standing here skips.
 *
 * mbx2DCtxInitialize allocates a 124-byte context, and its FIRST act is
 * `r4 = mbxConnectionOpen(); if (r4) return NULL`. That single call is why
 * mbx2DGlobalContext is NULL in this VM and why SpringBoard dies in
 * _mbx2DDisable: no connection, no context, no hardware path. It is included
 * here so the connection's behaviour is observed rather than guessed at.
 *
 * THESE ARE OBSERVE, under the same order-of-work rule as everything above.
 * What they buy first is a call count and an argument shape taken at the site
 * itself -- whether the connection is even attempted, whether it succeeds now
 * that the kext attaches, and whether any blit follows. A replacement needs
 * that evidence first, and then still has to satisfy contract items 4 and 6:
 * every pixel through the guest MMU, and a framebuffer diff against the same
 * run with the site disarmed.

 * cost is entirely sw_scanline, which shares it. The transcription is correct
 * and worth nothing, and with no calls the framebuffer diff never exercised it
 * either, so it goes back to OBSERVE rather than shipping on no evidence.

 *                          unsigned *out)
 *
 * The first argument is never read. Arguments 1-4 are r0-r3 and `out` is the
 * fifth, which at entry is [sp+0]: the function's own [sp,#0x20] references are
 * AFTER it pushes 0x20 bytes, and this fires before any of that has happened.
 *
 * A sibling of the sampler above and the same span shape -- walk `count`
 * pixels, divide by w per pixel, write one word each -- but it interpolates a
 * COLOUR rather than reading a texture, so no memory is read inside the loop at
 * all. It sits at 0x3122d02c, inside the 0x3122d000 page the profile put at
 * 13.7% of a swipe.
 *
 * ogl_poly_vert, the fields this one uses:
 *   +0x0c  float w         perspective divisor
 *   +0x10  float c[4]      colour components, in the order R, G, B, A
 *
 * Constants read from the literal pool rather than assumed:
 *   0x3122d174 = 0x4b7f0000 = 16711680.0f   which is 255.0f * 65536.0f
 *   0x3122d178 = 0x3f800000 = 1.0f          numerator of the reciprocal
 *   0x3122d17c = 0xffff0000                 the packing mask
 *
 * So a component is carried as 16.16 fixed point scaled to 0..255, and the
 * pack drops each one's fraction:
 *
 *   px = (r & 0xffff0000) | (b >> 16) | ((a >> 16) << 24) | ((g >> 16) << 8)
 *
 * which is 0xAARRGGBB -- the driver's own 'ARGB', matching what clcd.c decodes
 * a 32-bit window as. The R term is MASKED rather than shifted because its
 * integer part already sits at bits 16-23.
 *
 * THE SHIFTS ARE ARITHMETIC AND THERE IS NO CLAMP, which is the one thing that
 * must not be tidied up. The sampler above saturates with `bic`/`movge`; this
 * routine does not, so a component that goes negative sign-extends into the
 * neighbouring channel and that is the behaviour to reproduce exactly. Writing
 * the "obviously intended" clamp here would produce a different pixel from the
 * guest's on any span that overshoots, which is precisely what the framebuffer
 * diff would then catch -- and it is cheaper to be right than to be caught.

 * The proved hot arms of sw_scanline.
 *
 * This is not a rewrite of the 1,116-instruction function. It is the early
 * tail-call at 0x3122d2fc..0x3122d394, transcribed condition for condition:
 * one texture, no interpolated colour, a direct four-byte destination, no
 * auxiliary state bit, and the context's sentinel colour. In that arm the
 * guest does no blending at all; it calls sw_sample_texture directly into the
 * destination span and returns. r273 exercised this exact shape with both
 * nearest-BGRX8 and nearest-BGRA8 contexts.
 *
 * The dispatcher is bypassed only when its minification and magnification
 * function pointers are identical. That is the dispatcher's own first test at
 * 0x3122cf24, and means no derivative-dependent choice is being guessed. BGRX
 * is the BGRA transcription plus the guest's single `orr #0xff000000`.
 * r273 also proved one compositing arm: state byte 0x12, mode byte 1 and
 * nearest-BGRA8 enter blend selector 2 at 0x3122dcf4. That loop is the packed
 * premultiplied source-over transcription below. r293 then measured mode byte
 * 2 with mask 0x0308 and a constant colour at ctx+0x64. Its loop at
 * 0x3122d744..0x3122d7c0 modulates each sampled channel as
 * `colour * (texture + 1) >> 8` before entering that same selector. Both BGRA
 * and alpha-forced BGRX samplers occur in the retained trace. No interpolated
 * colour, other mode, or other blend selector is inferred.
 *
 * The zero-texture direct arm is smaller still. At 0x3122d26c..0x3122d2f8,
 * state 0x02 plus mask 0x0008 loads the constant pixel from ctx+0x64, calls
 * QuartzCore's import stub for _CGBlt_fillBytes, and returns. The retained
 * direct context uses 0xff000000. A second zero-texture context has state 0x12:
 * the guest expands its 0xfd000000 constant into a temporary span and enters
 * the same selector-2 blend. No interpolant is consumed in either case.
 * Everything else declines to Apple's code.

 * THE CONTEXT DUMP, which is the other half of what a native blit needs.

 * 320x96 at y=384, which is the dock. So the operation is
 *
 *   mbx2DCtxBlitCopy(ctx, srcX, srcY, dstX, dstY, width, height)
 *
 * and that agrees with how CA::RenderMBX2D::blit_copy_simple builds its six
 * arguments, with d->[0x80] and d->[0x84] as the extent. Source origin is always
 * (0,0) because each layer sets its own surface first.
 *
 * What the arguments do NOT say is where the pixels ARE. That lives in the
 * context, whose layout is read out of the setters:
 *
 *   ctx+0x00/04/08/0c   source surface      (SetSourceSurface's r1,r2,r3,byte)
 *   ctx+0x10/14/18/1c   destination surface (SetDestinationSurface, same shape)
 *   ctx+0x38/3c/40/44   scissor x,y,w,h
 *   ctx+0x4c/50/54      scaleX, scaleY (1.0f at init), "not unity" flag
 *   ctx+0x5c/60         fill and copy dispatch pointers
 *
 * Two of those words per surface are a base and a stride and one is a format
 * (it is compared against 0x68000 and 0x70000 in copyDispatchEVT2), but WHICH is
 * which cannot be read off the setters -- they only store. Printing the live
 * context at the moment of a blit answers it the same way the argument values
 * did: a base address is a large aligned number in the guest's address space, a
 * stride is a small multiple of the width, and a format is one of two constants.
