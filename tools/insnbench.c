/*
 * S5LBox — interpreter throughput benchmark.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. docs/dynarec.md §1.1-§1.2 records how fast the ARMv6
 * interpreter runs, and every one of those numbers was taken on one desktop
 * x86-64 box with an untracked scratch harness. The document says so itself:
 * "All throughput numbers are desktop x86 numbers." Every statement about the
 * target A9 is therefore an extrapolation from a host with a different ISA, a
 * different memory system and a different compiler.
 *
 * This tool is the reproducible half of that measurement. It is deliberately
 * NOT a ctest: it produces a number, not a verdict, and a number measured on a
 * shared, virtualised CI runner is not something a build should be gated on.
 * It is wired into .github/workflows/core-tests.yml's existing three-platform
 * matrix so that the SAME binary from the SAME commit runs on x86-64 Linux,
 * x86-64 Windows and arm64 macOS on the same day — which is the only way the
 * arm64/x86 ratio means anything.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
 *
 * It measures the interpreter's throughput on synthetic loops, reproducing the
 * six configurations §1.1-§1.2 used. It executes real guest instructions
 * through arm_step() — the same entry point tools/bootkernel.c and the iOS app
 * use — on a real s5l8900_t machine, so every access goes through the same
 * arm_mmu_translate/bus_read dispatch chain a boot uses. Nothing here bypasses
 * decode, and nothing hand-rolls a dispatcher.
 *
 * It does NOT measure real guest code. Real code is branchier, is 68.95% Thumb
 * (§1.3), and has a different memory-instruction mix; a synthetic loop is an
 * upper bound on a real workload and the document treats it as one. The
 * rows that say "MMU on" DO include the full ARMv6 page-table walk on every
 * instruction fetch and on every data access, because there is no TLB (§6.1) —
 * that is precisely what the MMU-off/MMU-on pair is here to price.
 *
 * HOW THE RATE IS COMPUTED. The divisor is arm_cpu_t::cycles, the core's own
 * retired-instruction counter, sampled before and after the timed region — not
 * a count this file keeps. The step loop's own iteration count is compared
 * against it afterwards and a mismatch is a hard failure, so a run that retired
 * fewer instructions than it stepped (an exception, a fault, a halt) cannot be
 * silently divided into a large-looking rate.
 *
 * AND WHY THE WORKLOAD CANNOT BE OPTIMISED AWAY. arm_step() lives in libemucore
 * in a different translation unit and the build uses no LTO, so the compiler
 * cannot see through it, let alone delete it. Independently of that, every run
 * is checked against an architectural end state that could only hold if every
 * instruction really executed — the load/store loop leaves its iteration count
 * in *guest memory*, read back through the machine bus — and the checked values
 * are folded into a sink that is printed. A run that executed nothing fails
 * loudly instead of reporting an enormous rate.

/*  MIXED -- ten instructions that land in TEN DIFFERENT PLACES in the ARM

 * WHY THIS ROW EXISTS. Every other row in this file is a homogeneous loop: the

 * jump table -- it is a long chain of `if ((insn & mask) == value)` tests -- so
 * a homogeneous loop settles into ONE position in that chain and the host's
 * branch predictor learns it perfectly. Real guest code does not. That makes
 * every synthetic number in this file a best case for the decoder specifically,
 * which is exactly the component under suspicion.
 *
 * The 7.3x gap between the synthetic rows and a real boot (30.92 vs 4.21 M
 * insn/s) has two candidate explanations that the existing rows cannot tell
 * apart: real code is BRANCHIER AND COLDER (i-cache, TLB, indirect targets), or
 * real code is DECODE-SCATTERED. This row changes only the second one -- same
 * loop shape, same tight working set, same host cache behaviour, ten decode

     * WHY THE MEDIAN IS THE HEADLINE, AND NOT BEST-OF-N.
     *
     * Best-of-N is the usual choice, and the usual argument for it is sound as
     * far as it goes: a neighbour competing for the machine can only ever ADD
     * time to a fixed amount of work, so the fastest of N samples is the one
     * least contaminated. That argument silently assumes the host executes at a
     * fixed rate, and no host this runs on does. A laptop and a cloud runner
     * both scale frequency, and a repetition that happens to land in a boost
     * window finishes genuinely faster without the interpreter having done
     * anything differently. Best-of-N then reports peak boost rather than
     * sustained throughput — and, worse, reports it unevenly across rows.
     *
     * That is not hypothetical: measured on the project's dev box, best-of-5
     * inverted two rows relative to their medians, ranking a configuration with
     * a two-level page-table walk on every access AHEAD of the same loop with
     * the MMU disabled entirely. The median cannot do that, because it is the
     * only one of the three statistics robust in BOTH directions — against a
     * neighbour that inflates elapsed time and against a boost window that
     * deflates it. Best and worst are printed beside it so the spread stays
     * visible and the choice stays falsifiable.
     *
     * WHY THE REPETITIONS ARE INTERLEAVED. Running all N repetitions of one
     * configuration before starting the next makes the table an ordering
     * artefact on any host whose clock rate depends on how long it has been
     * busy. The two tick=yes rows here are several times longer than the
     * others, so a configuration measured immediately after one of them was
     * being priced against a hotter, slower CPU than the one measured first.
     * Sweeping all six configurations once per repetition spreads each row's
     * samples across the whole session instead, so a drift that is monotonic in
     * time falls on every row roughly equally.
