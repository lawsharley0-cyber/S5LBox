/*
 * The record written over the guest's own. The last field is the fsck PASS
 * NUMBER, and it is 0 -- "never check at boot" -- rather than the 1 a real
 * iPhone carries. That is a deliberate difference from the hardware, so here
 * is the whole reason.
 *
 * THE VOLUME IS NOT JOURNALED. The HFS+ volume header at byte 1024 of the
 * source image reads attributes 0x00000100: kHFSVolumeUnmountedBit set,
 * kHFSVolumeJournaledBit CLEAR. On real hardware a dirty mount replays a
 * journal in moments; with no journal there is nothing to replay, so fsck_hfs
 * falls back to a full structural scan of all 445 MB.
 *
 * AND THE VOLUME IS ALWAYS DIRTY AFTER THE FIRST RUN. Closing the app does not
 * unmount the guest's root filesystem -- there is no guest shutdown path yet --
 * so every launch after the first inherits an uncleanly-mounted volume and
 * pays that full scan at emulator speed before anything can happen. A first
 * launch is fast because it starts from a pristine copy; the second is not,
 * which is exactly the shape of the problem as reported.
 *
 * WHAT IS GIVEN UP. A volume that really is damaged will no longer be repaired
 * automatically at boot. That is a genuine loss and is accepted knowingly: the
 * cost being avoided is minutes on EVERY launch, against a repair pass that
 * cannot fix a torn write in a 445 MB image any better than recreating it can.
 * VMFirmwareBoot.c already deletes and remakes an INCOMPLETE work image, which
 * is the failure this project actually produces.
 *
 * THE BETTER FIXES, in the order they should replace this one: unmount cleanly
 * on exit, or resume from a snapshot so the volume is never left dirty at all.
 * Both need work that does not exist yet; this is one character and available
 * now.
 *
 * SIZE-NEUTRAL, which is load-bearing. rootfs_work rewrites the fstab record
 * in place and cannot change its length, so 1 -> 0 keeps the record byte count
 * identical. Any longer replacement would be refused.
 *
 * bootkernel keeps its own literal and is deliberately NOT changed: its runs
 * each create a fresh work image, so their volumes are clean and their fsck is
 * already quick, and every instruction index recorded in docs/BOOTLOG.md was
 * taken with pass 1.

/*
 * Bounds for the catalog provisioner below.  Every one of them is a policy cap
 * enforced with a named refusal rather than a truncation, and the state each
 * one bounds is heap-allocated, so raising a constant costs only memory.
 *
 * AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS COMMENT WAS WRONG and the correction is worth
 * keeping.  It claimed raising ROOTFS_WORK_MAX_ENTRIES from 64 was "the whole
 * change needed to admit a larger payload".  It was not.  A batch of entries is
 * not one ascending run of keys even when the caller's paths are sorted:
 * creating file f under folder P writes a name key (P, f) AND a thread key
 * (cnid(f), ""), and every cnid handed out is larger than P, so the SECOND file
 * under P has to be inserted between the first file's name record and the first
 * file's thread record.  Once that stretch of the tree fills one leaf, the next
 * name record is an interior insert into a full leaf -- which the writer used
 * to refuse by name (PROVISION_NODE_FULL) because the only split it had was the
 * rightmost append.
 *
 * MEASURED, not reasoned: with the cap raised and nothing else changed, the
 * 678-entry scale request in core/tests/test_rootfs_provision.c refused after
 * THREE entries -- "leaf 8 has 186 free bytes, the record needs 274" -- and the
 * record it could not place was the second file in the payload's first
 * directory.  catalog_node_split() in rootfs_work.c is the general split added
 * to fix it, and that test is what now holds the fix to 678 entries, 665 leaf
 * splits and 58 index splits deep.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL A STRUCTURAL LIMIT, and it is not one of these constants:
 * splitting the B-tree's ROOT is not implemented, so a request that would have
 * to grow a new root and increment treeDepth is a PROVISION_SPLIT_UNSUPPORTED
 * refusal.  On the shipping 7E18 catalog it should be far out of reach -- that
 * volume's root index node was measured at 3280 free bytes against 15 children
 * (see catalog_level_extend(), a prior measurement not re-checked here), and a
 * 644-entry payload is roughly 1300 catalog records, which at that volume's
 * 4096-byte nodes is on the order of a hundred new leaves and so a handful of
 * new level-2 index records in the root.  The scale test starts a depth-4 tree
 * with a deliberately roomy root for the same reason and finishes without
 * needing to grow it.  UNVERIFIED against the real firmware image: no test in
 * this suite opens firmware/rootfs.img.

/*
 * 1024.  The acquired Cydia payload is 555 regular files plus 89 symlinks --

 * measured here.  1024 admits 644 with half again in headroom, plus the two

 * that provisions data_ark.plist creates it.  A missing options file is not
 * fatal to pppd, which is why the file does not exist to begin with and why
 * creating it needs the catalog rather than an overwrite.

 * file is created; asking for the parent too made the provisioner refuse the

 * give configd the matching persistent PPPSerial service. These are one
 * transaction: a short buffer is left untouched rather than producing a
