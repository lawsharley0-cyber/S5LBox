# Audio: the codec answers and the I²S windows are decoded

**Status: landed.** `AppleWM8991Audio: I2C register read failed (0): device
error` is gone. The codec is modelled in `core/src/soc/wm8991.c` as an I²C slave
at `0x1B` on i2c0, both I²S windows are decoded device models in
`core/src/soc/i2s.c`, and the two landed together for the reason the warning
below gives. `SNAPSHOT_VERSION` went 10 -> 11.

### The proof, from run87

Absence of an error line is not evidence that a probe succeeded — it is equally
consistent with the driver never running. So run87 armed
`--call-probe-kernel` on the four branches of `AppleWM8991Audio::probe`
(`0xc068b078`, codec vtable slot `+0x178`) and read the registers directly:

```
=== CALL PROBE: CONFIGURED PCs (4) ===
    pc 0xc068b0bc  kernel  captured 1             wrong-mode 0
    pc 0xc068b0f8  kernel  captured 0             wrong-mode 0
    pc 0xc068b118  kernel  captured 1             wrong-mode 0
    pc 0xc068b0ec  kernel  captured 1             wrong-mode 0

    @180963570    pc c068b0bc lr c068b218 ...  r0 00008990 ... r3 00008990
    @180974355    pc c068b0ec lr c068b218 ...  r0 00000000 ...
    @180974358    pc c068b118 lr c068b218 ...  r0 00000000 ...
```

Read that against the disassembly. `0xc068b0bc` is the instruction after
`bne 0xc068b118`, so it executes **only when `readCodecRegister(0)` equalled the
literal**: the capture shows `r0 = 0x00008990` against `r3 = 0x00008990`, which
is the emulated codec's answer arriving over the emulated bus and matching.
`0xc068b0ec` is `ands r0, r0, #0x20` on the value read back from register 1;
`r0 = 0` means bit 5 did **not** stick. `0xc068b0f8` is the first instruction of
the WM1817 branch and captured **zero**. Both runs report the failure line zero
times where run62 reported it once:

```
run62: 1     run86: 0     run87: 0
```

The console around the old failure now reads straight through:

```
Jettisoning kext bootstrap segment.
AppleS5L8900XSDIO: registers @ vaddr 0xe9205000, paddr 0x38d00000
* memMapEntries 6
+ AppleMPVDDriver[0xdc877800]::setPowerStateGated()
ApplePCF50635PMU::start: reading DOWN converter voltages
```

Both runs are 300e6 cold boots with the stock arguments
(`-d devicetree.bin -r rootfs.img -R 512`); the probe fires at instruction
180,963,570.

### The correction this section owed you: R1 bit 5 is inverted

The previous text said "**R1 bit 5 must be writable and read back**". That is
wrong, and building to it would have produced a part the driver calls by the
wrong name. The bit-5 sequence is **not a second gate** — it is a variant
discriminator, and both of its branches return the same success value:

```
c068b0ec  ands   r0, r0, #0x20        ; bit 5 of register 1
c068b0f0  strbeq r0, [r4, #0xc0]      ; clear  -> this->flag = 0
c068b0f4  beq    #0xc068b118          ; clear  -> return, still successful
c068b0f8  mov    r1, #1               ; set    -> this->flag = 1
```

and the getter at `0xc068b044` turns that flag into a name — `moveq` selects
`0xc0690158` `"WM8991"` when the flag is **0**, leaving `0xc0690150` `"WM1817"`
when it is 1. **A part whose R1 bit 5 sticks is reported as a WM1817.** The
shipped device tree calls both of its audio nodes `wm8991`
(`audio-control,wm8991` on i2c0, `audio-data,wm8991` on i2s0) and contains no
occurrence of `1817` anywhere in its 40,544 bytes, so on this board the bit must
read back **clear**. The model leaves it unimplemented: writes are discarded,
reads return zero. This is not cosmetic — the flag is loaded from `this+0xc0` at
ten further sites in the kext.

Register 0 is the **only** hard gate, and it was verified three ways: the word
at `0xc068b124` is `0x00008990` read at the byte level; `0xc068b0ac` is the sole
instruction in the entire kernelcache that loads that literal; and entry 0 of
the driver's own default table at `0xc0691030` is the same `0x8990`.

### The wire protocol, from the helpers rather than a datasheet

`AppleWM8991Audio` inherits its transfer helpers from `AppleEmbeddedAudio`
(`0xc053e000..0xc054c000`, ARM) and reaches them through its vtable
(`V = 0xc0690b20`, base `V = 0xc054867c`; the two tables are structurally
aligned and three separate slots — `+0x178`, `+0x39c`, `+0x3a4` — are
superclass calls at the same offset, which is what pins the bases).

- **read**, `0xc053ff94`: one index byte out, then **two bytes in, MSB first**.
  The assembling instruction is the claim: `ldrb r3,[sp,#0xe]; ldrb r0,[sp,#0xf];
  orr r0,r0,r3,lsl #8` at `0xc0540030..38`. On failure this is the helper that
  prints `%s: I2C register read failed (%#x): %s` (`0xc0548048`) — the exact
  format behind the old `(0): device error`, `%#x` of zero rendering bare.
- **write**, `0xc0540050`: index byte, then the value MSB-first — three bytes.
  This is the form the codec uses (`writeCodecRegister` `0xc068b168` dispatches
  to it).
- A second, **packed** form exists at `0xc0540108` — `(reg << 1) | value[8]`,
  then `value[7:0]`, two bytes — but it belongs to the WM8758 sibling driver.

The model implements both and lets the **byte count** select: one byte is a
pointer-only write (the stock controller's read setup, which must not be
committed as a store), two is packed, three is wide, anything else is NAKed and
counted. The counts are distinct, so nothing guesses.

**Only six registers ever reach the bus.** `readCodecRegister` (`0xc068b1b4`)
gates every read on the bitmap `0x0084000f` at `0xc068b21c` via
`ands r3, r2, r3, lsl r1` over `1 << reg`; set bits {0,1,2,3,18,23} mean
registers **`0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x12, 0x17`** and nothing else. Every other
read is served from a RAM shadow the driver seeds from `0xc0691030`.

### The one thing that is inferred rather than observed

The codec's GPIO configure path holds a poll with **no timeout, no iteration cap
and no delay in its body**, at `0xc068d4ac..0xc068d514`:

```
rmw(0x17, 0x1000, level << 12);           // c068d44c, before the loop
do { write(0x17, computed);               // c068d4cc
     write(0x12, last & 0x0000efff);      // c068d4e8 — clears bit 12
     v = read(0x12); }                    // c068d4fc
while ((v & ~arg & 0x1000) != (level << 12));   // c068d50c
```

It forces bit 12 of `0x12` clear on every write and then waits for that same bit
to read back as `level`. So it cannot be waiting for storage: on a part where
`0x12` bit 12 held what was last written, `level == 1` never terminates. The
model therefore makes **`0x12` bit 12 a read-only mirror of `0x17` bit 12** and
nothing more. That is an inference from the poll's own structure, deliberately
the narrowest one that lets a loop with no exit but the device finish; it is
counted (`status_mirror_reads`) so a boot can say how often it mattered.

### The I²S side: both prior claims verified, independently

`readRegister` (`0xc05a3c84`) really **has no caller anywhere in the
kernelcache**. Four checks agree: its address occurs as an aligned word exactly
once in the file (its own vtable slot `0xc05ad888`); no ARM or Thumb BL/BLX
targets it; no `ldr pc,[Rn,#0x3c0]` dispatch exists with any base but PC; and
slot `+0x3c0` is a virtual the class *introduces* — its parent
`AppleARMIISController`'s vtable ends at `+0x3ac` — so no other kext can reach
it through a base pointer even in principle. The class contains exactly **one**
MMIO load instruction in the whole image and it is dead code.

`writeRegister` writes exactly the seven claimed offsets, enumerated from every
dispatch site: `configure()` `0xc05a3820` writes `+0x00` (cfg|1), `+0x40`,
`+0x04` (cfg|1), `+0x30`, `+0x08` (0), `+0x34` (0), `+0x3c` (1, if TX);
`startTransfer()` `0xc05a3928` writes `+0x08` and `+0x34` with **6**; `stop()`
`0xc05a3ad0` writes both with **0**. Distinct set = `{0x00, 0x04, 0x08, 0x30,
0x34, 0x3c, 0x40}`.

Two further facts worth carrying. **`start()` cannot spin**: `0xc05a3d24..
0xc05a3f58` performs zero MMIO and contains zero backward branches. And the
class is **ARM** while its parent `AppleARMPlatform` is Thumb — its vtable's own
class entries are all even where the inherited ones are odd. The transfer wait
at `0xc05a39a0` is `commandSleep(..., 1)`, i.e. `THREAD_ABORTSAFE` **and
timer-bounded**, and depends on the GPIO-IC interrupt (`0x86` for i2s0, `0xaa`
for i2s1) or the timeout — never on a register value. The five unbounded waits
§23.9 warned about are one layer up, in `AppleARMIISAudio`/`AppleEmbeddedAudio`
(`IOLockSleep` at `0xc053a5f8`, `0xc053a644`, `0xc05429d4`, `0xc0542a74`).

The windows are `0x3CA00000` and `0x3CD00000`, both 0x1000. i2s0 carries the
codec (`/arm-io/i2s0/audio0`, `audio-data,wm8991`); i2s1 carries the baseband
voice path (`audio-data,baseband`). They are still recording **zero** MMIO
traffic after this change — they do not appear in run86's 15-page census — which
is exactly what the dead-`readRegister` analysis predicts, since nothing writes
them until a transfer is actually configured.

### What was deliberately NOT modelled

- **The 63-entry default register table** at `0xc0691030`. It is the driver's
  own belief about an untouched part and the driver never needs the device to
  supply it; copying it in would be the full register map this model refuses to
  invent. Its entry 0 agreeing with the identity literal is recorded above as
  corroboration, not as a reason to ship the other 62.
- **Any semantics for the seven I²S offsets.** The `+0x08`/`+0x34` pattern
  (0 configured, 6 running, 0 stopped) is consistent with a per-direction
  enable and bit 0 is forced set at `+0x00`/`+0x04`, but "consistent with" is
  not "established". The model stores; it does not interpret.
- **Any interrupt line.** There is no `S5L8900_IRQ_I2S0/1` constant, for the
  same reason there is no `S5L8900_IRQ_UART4`: the `interrupts` properties say
  `0x86`/`0xaa` but both nodes name `interrupt-parent = /arm-io/gpio`, so they
  are GPIO-IC lines, and nothing in this model raises either.
- **The other i2c0 nodes** — accelerometer `0x1d`, ALS `0x44`, tethered `0x29`.
  Nothing establishes what they must answer, and an address that NAKs is a
  driver that fails cleanly, which is what all three do today.
- **The PL080, and any host audio sink.** Samples still need the DMAC; host
  playback needs a portable sink that must never block the CPU thread, and
  `core/` has no threading vocabulary. Both are separate work.

### Tests and mutants

`core/tests/test_wm8991.c` — 11 cases, 493 checks, registered as
`wm8991_codec_and_i2s`. Suite 34 -> 35 (36 with the buttons work that landed
alongside). The codec is driven through the **real** I²C controller using the
stock register sequence, so a change to `i2c.c` that broke it fails here rather
than only in a six-minute boot.

**14 mutants, 14 killed, 0 survived.** Two of them are worth carrying:

- *the mutant that survived first.* Removing the seven-bit wrap from the read
  auto-increment changed nothing, because a second mask at the point of use made
  it redundant — and that redundancy was hiding a real bug: a pointer-only write
  of index byte `0xff` stored `ptr = 0xff`, which the snapshot invariant
  (`ptr < 0x80`) then rejected. A guest-reachable byte made the machine unable to
  checkpoint. Narrowing at the point of *store* fixed the bug and made the
  mutant killable.
- *the mutant the harness refused to score.* Changing `WM8991_I2C_ADDR` from
  `0x1b` to `0x1a` survived, because every test used the symbol. Constants need
  a test that spells out the literal and cites where in the firmware it comes
  from; `test_constants_match_the_shipped_firmware` is that test.

The harness (a) rebuilds and requires the mutant to **compile** before believing
any result, and (b) diffs the file and reports `INVALID` rather than "survived"
when an edit does not apply. It caught one genuine no-op edit this way.

### Tooling note

`tools/kdisasm.py`, `dtwalk.py`, `findstr.py`, `vtscan.py` and `kcensus.py` all
hardcode `REPO = F:\JOSHUA_1st_2021\projects\S5LBox`, which does not exist on
this machine — they fail immediately. `machosyms.py` and `findcalls.py` take a
path argument and work. `kdisasm.py`'s `SEGS` table itself is correct for this
image, verified against the file's own `LC_SEGMENT` commands.

**run62 settled the question that branched the plan.** `--call-probe-kernel` on
`AppleS5L8900XI2SController::start`'s tail: `0xc05a3f40` (publishChildren) and
`0xc05a3f44` (return true) each **captured 2**, `0xc05a3f4c` (return false)
captured **0**. Both controllers publish, at instructions 235,126,205 and
236,694,444. So the `AppleARMIISDevice` nub named `audio0` **exists today**, the
two `IODMAEventSource`s are created successfully, and the three NULL-timeout
`waitForService` calls ahead of it already resolve.

Consequence: **the PL080 can be deferred.** Steps 1-2 — the codec slave plus the
I²S window — are 2-3 days and produce a fully attached codec with a live
`IOAudio2Family`. Samples need the PL080 later, and there is **no boot-argument
escape** for it: all 40 `PE_parse_boot_argn` sites were enumerated and the
`<node>_dma_enable` pattern exists only in `AppleS5L8900XSerial`.

The I²S window itself is nearly free. The driver funnels access through two
accessors and **`readRegister` (`c05a3c84`) has no caller anywhere in the
kernelcache** — it writes seven offsets (`0x00, 0x04, 0x08, 0x30, 0x34, 0x3C,
0x40`) and never reads. The FIFOs at `+0x10`/`+0x38` are touched only by the
PL080 as physical addresses in an LLI. That independently explains the zero
MMIO traffic the census shows on `0x3CA00000`/`0x3CD00000`, and makes the window
80-120 lines rather than 250-350.

Two things to keep honest about scope. **Nothing makes a sound today** and
nothing would even with a perfect stack: the activation screen is silent and
iPhone OS 3 has no boot chime, so audio output is downstream of touch exactly as
Wi-Fi is. And **you cannot hear it live** — at 200-294× slower than the 412 MHz
part, the smallest UI sound costs about 6 seconds of wall clock and one guest
second costs about 200. The right design is to clock the model off the guest
timebase, capture PCM to a WAV, and let the host play it back afterwards.

One method note worth carrying. Before run62, the evidence for the nub was that
the device tree declares 14 DMA channels while only 10 initialise, a shortfall
of exactly 4 matching i2s0's 2 plus i2s1's 2. That fit was suggestive and
**wrong** — other partitions exist, the analysis labelled it cannot-determine
rather than concluding from the coincidence, and a four-minute read-only run
settled it properly. The tidy arithmetic would have sent the plan down the
expensive branch.

# 23.8 The trap that has now cost three retractions

A per-process trace block that reports one generation does not describe the
whole run, and **host-side counters are not machine state**: `core/include/snapshot.h`
says a restored process starts them fresh, so a zero in a restored run means
"not seen since the restore point", never "never happened". On 2026-07-26 that
misreading produced a committed claim that `AppleH1CLCD::createSurface` never
ran, when it runs and succeeds at instruction ~238,400,000.

**Compare the heartbeat pc stream before reading divergence into differing
counters.** Restore is bit-exact — 20/20 heartbeats identical between cold run52
and restored run56 across 3.0e9-4.9e9, agreeing 862 million instructions past
the restore point, across three different binaries.

# 2026-09-18 The AMC "lock BSU" freeze — real bug, root cause not yet safe to fix

**User-reported, on real hardware, real firmware, reproduces every time:**
opening Settings > Sounds and playing a sound freezes the guest. Confirmed
via the app's own Console output that this is the **same failure that fires
automatically during ordinary boot**, right after `launchd[N] Builtin
profile: MobileMail (seatbelt)`, with no user interaction required — the
Sounds-screen trigger just makes an already-present, already-silently-firing
loop visible in the foreground.

**What the guest console actually shows, every time, in a tight cycle:**
```
Assertion failed in ".../AppleAMCDriver_r1.cpp" at line 350/565/726
ERROR: AMC reset [non-fatal error]: could not lock BSU!
AppleEmbeddedAudioDevice: could not start DMA: operation was aborted
```
repeating forever, separated by a bounded ~1200-cycle WFI delay loop.

## What is confirmed, not guessed

- **This is an active busy-retry loop, not a silent/uninterruptible sleep.**
  The host UI stays fully responsive (confirmed by the user); only the guest
  pegs a CPU core retrying. `bootkernel`'s own `[stall]` sampler independently
  corroborates this: "the guest is looping in N regions... 0xc0062300-0xc006233f
  took 508 of 512 samples" — decoded (`kdisasm.py --arm 0xc00622c0 0xa0`) as a
  standard bounded delay primitive: `mov r3,#0x4b0` (1200), a
  `mcr p15,0,r2,c7,c10,4` (DSB) + `mcr p15,0,r2,c7,c0,4` (WFI) + decrement
  loop. The loop itself is correct, ordinary kernel code; it is the *outer*
  retry that never succeeds.
- **Not the build-time compact AArch64 engine.** This session shipped a
  "Force Interpreter" developer-mode toggle (`VMEngine.h`/`.m`,
  `EmulatorViewController.m`, commit `164c435`) specifically to test this.
  With the interpreter forced on (compact engine fully disabled), the freeze
  reproduces identically. Whatever this is, it is not an AOT translation bug.
- **Not jailbreak/Cydia state.** Reproduces on a freshly created machine with
  no `jb-payload` baked in, exactly as it does on a jailbroken one.
- **Traced to a real write-then-poll-readback register coupling**, the same
  bug *class* `s5l_power_t`'s own header already documents at length for
  `AppleS5L8900XPowerController::start`'s `STATE` register (a storage stub
  cannot fix "write register A, poll register B" — only "poll the register
  you already own"). Two call targets were resolved from this session's own
  extracted `firmware/kernel.macho` (byte-verified, see
  `PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`): `0xc0717838` and `0xc0717434`. The second
  writes 0 to offset `+0x400` of some device object's mapped block, reads it
  back, and treats nonzero as "not yet cleared" — a classic
  write-a-request/poll-for-hardware-self-clear pattern.

## What was tried and did not work

`core/src/soc/machine.c`'s `clkrstgen` stub (`AppleS5L8900XClockController`,
`0x3c500000`) was reset-filled with `0xFFFFFFFF` instead of zero on the
hypothesis that a clock/power-gate status bit there was the one being polled
(commit `163f955`). **Tested on the user's real device: no change, freeze is
byte-for-byte identical.** This does not mean the fix was wrong in spirit —
`clkrstgen` may still be worth keeping reset-filled rather than zeroed on
general principle — but it rules out `clkrstgen` specifically as *this* bug's
register. The device the `+0x400` register actually belongs to is still
unidentified.

## Why this session stopped here, honestly

Continuing past the two resolved call targets requires reading literal-pool
values out of `__PRELINK_TEXT` by hand (`kdisasm.py` plus manual byte-order
math, no cross-referencing disassembler). One resolved value along that path
(`0x101c`) does not look like a valid kernel pointer, which means a
transcription or addressing error was made a step or two before it and not
caught — this class of manual reverse engineering is genuinely error-prone
past a certain depth without better tooling, and shipping a fix built on an
untrusted trace would repeat exactly the mistake `clkrstgen` already was.

This session also could not reproduce the freeze locally (Windows x86-64
desktop, pure interpreter, four attempts with progressively closer-matched
boot configuration including the user's exact jailbreak boot-args) — see
`PERFORMANCE_PLAN.md` §8 for the same cross-environment gap affecting the
CPU-performance track. Local reproduction would have made the rest of this
tractable; without it, the only way to get further evidence is from the
device itself.

## What would actually resolve this, for whoever picks it up next

1. **Xcode Instruments (Time Profiler or, better, a live `lldb` attach) on a
   Mac, against the real device, while reproducing the freeze.** This is a
   host-side native-code stack, not the emulated guest, so standard iOS
   debugging tools apply directly and would show the exact call chain and
   register/memory state in seconds, instead of the hours of static
   disassembly this session spent getting two call targets deep.
2. Failing that, redo the literal-pool trace from `0xc0717838`/`0xc0717434`
   from scratch with fresh eyes (do not reuse this session's intermediate
   arithmetic) and a proper cross-referencing disassembler if one becomes
   available, rather than `kdisasm.py`'s manual byte math.
3. The "Force Interpreter" toggle (Developer Mode → machine menu) now ships
   in the app and is generally useful for any future "is this an emulator
   bug or a translation bug" question, not just this one.

# 2026-09-23 Device-side evidence for the BSU loop, without a disassembler

The trace above stopped at "the device the `+0x400` register actually belongs
to is still unidentified". The machine now keeps, always on, the most recent
distinct accesses to hardware it does not model (unmapped addresses and
storage-only stubs), each with the guest pc, the value, and a repeat count
(`s5l8900_t::unmodelled`, `s5l_unmodelled_describe()`). A driver spinning on
a register it is waiting for shows up as a few lines with large counts.

To capture it on the device: boot, reproduce the freeze (it also fires on its
own after `launchd[N] Builtin profile: MobileMail (seatbelt)`; Settings >
Sounds makes it visible), wait for the console's `[stall]` line, which now
prints the most recent unmodelled accesses, then open Performance & Sound
Details and Copy Report. The pcs resolve to kernel symbols with
`machoinfo <kernel> -r <pc>`; the address and region name say which window
(`sram/amc`, a stub such as `clkrstgen`, or plain unmapped) the driver is
polling, and the value says what it keeps reading. That is the input a
register model needs; nothing is changed in the guest by collecting it.

## First device report (iPhone18,2, iOS 27.2, build 3a9ddef, 2026-09-23)

The run was on the forced interpreter (`(interpreter control)`), 6,627.6 M
instructions in, guest time 0.41x wall time; I2S0 received 0 words. The

What this shows, and what it does not:

- **Observed:** one ARM routine (c05a7e54-c05a7e78) read-modify-writes
  clkrstgen `+0x24`, toggling bit 0 (the stub stores writes, and the last
  read returned the bit clear while the last write set it), and on each pass
  writes the MIU's `+0x008` (0x1000) and `+0x404` (0) — the two MIU offsets
  already recorded as the clock controller's second range. About 19,500
  passes over the run. The `+0x404 <- 0` write is the "writes 0 to offset
  +0x400-ish" of the earlier trace; nothing ever reads it back.
- **Observed:** a Thumb routine (c06f4604-c06f5526) programs an unmapped
  block at 0x38d00000 (+0x3c, +0x34, +0x0c, +0x08 = 0x00040045), reads
  +0x10 once, then polls +0x18 exactly 10,001 times (reads 0) and gives up:
  a bounded poll timing out. `BOOTLOG.md` records
  `AppleS5L8900XSDIO::sendCommand(): Timeout waiting for CMDRDY`; that this
  block is the SDIO controller is a **hypothesis** until the pcs are
  resolved to symbols.
- **Not observed:** any access to the `sram/amc` window (0x22000000) among
  these entries, and nothing reads back a register that the loop above
  could be waiting on. The next build therefore also logs the most recent
  accesses to **modelled** devices (`s5l8900_t::mmio_recent`), because a
  poll on the power controller or another modelled block would not appear
  in the unmodelled table at all.

To resolve the pcs with your own kernelcache on a desktop:
`machoinfo <kernel> -r c05a7e54`, `-r c06f5526`.

## Second device report (build 3f74a82): the BSU lock is AMC +0x400

With every device access logged, the retry loop is fully visible (unmodelled
table, most recent first; counts are since each entry was last inserted):

- `c05a7e54/60/78`: clkrstgen +0x24 bit 0 toggled and MIU +0x008/+0x404
  written, x13,174; `c0717714`: **W 0x38502000 <- 3**, x13,174 — the AMC
  reset, once per retry.
- `c07174cc/c07174d4` then `c07174fc/c0717504`: **W 0x38500400 <- 1, R
  0x38500400 -> 0**, x3 and x3,000 — the lock: write 1, read it back,
  up to 1,000 times per attempt, give up when it stays 0.
- After it, one pass of set-up: 0x38501000..0x3850101c (a channel: enable,
  **0x095b5000** — a DRAM address — and 0xfef, i.e. a 4,080-byte buffer),
  0x38500a00, 0x38500004, 0x38500b04/0b0c, 0x38500204, polls of 0x38500b18
  (x11) and 0x38500010, and two halfword reads of SRAM 0x22028000.

0x38500000 is `/arm-io/amc` reg[0] (child 0x00500000 in the first arm-io
window); 0x22000000 is its reg[1], the SRAM. Neither was modelled, so every
read returned 0 and the lock could never be taken.

Change: both are declared as honest storage (`S5L8900_AMC_BASE`, 0x3000
bytes, the span the driver touched; `S5L8900_SRAM_BASE`, 0x2c000). Reads
return what the guest wrote, so the lock read-back sees the 1 it wrote. That
is storage, not a fabricated status. What it does NOT do: move audio. The
channel at +0x1000 names a DRAM buffer and a length, which looks like the
AMC fetching samples itself rather than the PL080 feeding I2S0; if the next
report shows the driver waiting on +0x0b18/+0x0010 for progress, that is a
real DMA model to build (AMC -> audio sink), with its registers read from
the driver's own accesses.
