# The iPhone OS 3 boot chain: current path and full-chain target

The long-term target is to satisfy each stage of Apple's secure boot chain as
the silicon does. That is not the path implemented today. `runfw` has executed
an extracted real LLB payload, while `bootkernel` enters XNU directly after
synthesizing a subset of iBoot's handoff. SecureROM is not modelled and iBoot
itself has not executed.

```
  SecureROM (bootrom)   ← baked into the SoC; not modelled
        │  loads + verifies
        ▼
  LLB (Low-Level Bootloader)   ← extracted payload runs in runfw
        │
        ▼
  iBoot                        ← not yet executed
        │  sets up, loads + verifies
        ▼
  kernelcache (XNU)            ← currently entered directly by bootkernel
        │  hands off
        ▼
  launchd  →  SpringBoard      ← from the root filesystem DMG in the IPSW
```

The arrows describe the full-chain target. They are not a claim that the current
emulator has reproduced each verification or handoff stage.

## What each stage needs from the emulator

| Stage | Emulator must provide |
|---|---|
| SecureROM | **Future full-chain work:** reset vector, initial memory map, crypto engines and DFU/recovery behavior. No SecureROM stub or dump is executed today. |
| LLB / iBoot | The current core/NOR/UART/timer model is sufficient for the recorded standalone LLB run. Executing iBoot and reproducing its signature-verification policy remain future work. |
| kernelcache | The current direct path provides VICs, timers, ARM1176 WFI wake handling, MMU/TLB maintenance, a device tree and an iBoot-like handoff. Historical mode validates a 512 MiB layout and streams the root filesystem into guest RAM. The current cold path instead exact-gates the 7E18 kernel, device tree, and rootfs, fixes guest DRAM at 128 MiB, and serves a create-only work image through guarded md strategy/raw bridges. The real-firmware-tested raw fix exact-patches `_mdevrw` to `svc #0xe3; svc #0xe4`; `ARM_SVC_REDIRECTED` sends a missing user mapping through exact Thumb `_uiomove64` at `0xc0128d14`, using four 128 KiB SP-and-mode-keyed bounce slots below `topOfKernelData`. A zero-initialized coherent 128 KiB in-memory tail preserves XNU's observed no-EOF-check behavior without growing either disk image. Run07 retained two redirects and two completions with no guest raw error or pending continuation through a clean 2 B cap. NAND-controller/VFL/FTL integration remains a separate hardware-fidelity path. |
| launchd → SpringBoard | Display-enabled run15 completed a fresh 2 B cold run with `OK` and empty stderr. It decoded exact `POSIX_SPAWN_SETEXEC`, followed image activation/load, observed result `r0=0`, and revalidated the replacement task/proc/PID. The exact process retired 37,134,545 attributed user instructions, reached stock SpringBoard's `LC_UNIXTHREAD`/exported `start` at `0x34e8`, and later executed genuine SpringBoard Objective-C methods. It never entered exact-process `_exit1` and ended scheduled out in a validated `mach_msg` trap. No guest-driven live-scanout mutation or useful frame followed. Completion still needs the display-driver/window-server handoff, a recognizable home screen, multitouch, and enough IOKit-backed devices for remaining userland. |

The synthesized display handoff is being corrected before that last stage is
tested. CLCD offsets `0x0d8..0x0ec` are per-window auxiliary configuration, not
panel timing; the actual `VIDTCON0..3` timing registers live at
`0x20c..0x218`. The N82 seed now carries the iBoot-compatible 54 MHz display
clock divided by five, inverted-VCLK polarity, and porch/sync state.
`VIDTCON2` derives from the requested geometry, with production using 320x480,
and the initial `0x0d8`, `0x0e0`, and `0x0e8` window words are `0x1000`. A
configured window counts as live scanout only while start state, `CLCD_CTRL`
global enable, and `VIDCON0` bit 0 are all active. This removes false-positive
frames and wake events. Run15 populated the exact activation diagnostic:
SETEXEC was present, image activation and `_load_machfile` ran, the kernel
epilogue returned zero, and the replacement process reached the signed stock
SpringBoard executable's exported entry plus later application methods. That
closes the launch-request ambiguity. It does not close the visual boundary:
guest CLCD programming and exact-process/live-scanout mutations remained zero,
and the retained seed is not proof of driver start or rendering.

The accepted kernel, device tree, and rootfs source files remain original and
immutable. Exact firmware-specific patches and device-tree edits touch only
loaded guest RAM; fstab and volume-growth edits touch only the separate
create-only work image.

## IMG3 — Apple's firmware container

3.x-era firmware images are wrapped in the **IMG3** format: a tagged container
holding the payload, its encryption info and signature material. The current
loader:

1. Parse the IMG3 tags (`TYPE`, `DATA`, `KBAG`, `SHSH`, `CERT`, …).
2. Decrypt the `DATA` payload with **AES-128/256-CBC** using the image's key+IV.
3. Records whether `SHSH` and `CERT` are present, but **does not verify their RSA
   signatures**. Parsing/decryption is therefore not a secure-boot trust result.

## Firmware & keys — you supply your own

**S5LBox ships no Apple firmware.** Apple firmware is copyrighted; distributing
it is not something this project does. Instead, at runtime you provide:

1. **An iPhone OS 3.1.3 IPSW** for the matching device (an S5L8900 model). IPSWs
   are still widely archived; you download your own.
2. **The decryption key and IV** for each encrypted image. The repository has no
   `keys.json` loader: pass these values explicitly to the relevant tool or
   provide already-extracted inputs to the CLI harness.

The repository-root `firmware/` directory is ignored by default. That is a
convenience, not a security boundary: inspect staged files before every push and
never force-add firmware, keys or decrypted Apple payloads. You are responsible
for using material you are entitled to use and for following applicable law.

### The app can now do the unpacking itself

`app/Sources/VMFirmwareImport.{h,c}` runs the whole procedure below on the phone
from a `.ipsw` the user picks: it reads `Restore.plist` to identify the device
and name the members, unwraps the IMG3 containers, decompresses the kernel,
decrypts and expands the root filesystem's `Apple_HFSX` partition, and checks
each result against the SHA-256 of the known-good artefact. Verified end to end
against the real 7E18 archive: all three outputs are byte-identical to the files
in `firmware/`.

It ships no keys and fetches none. Every payload in a 3.x IPSW is AES-encrypted
and the keys are not in the archive, so the app asks the user for the ones it
needs and says precisely which artefact is waiting on which key. Without keys it
still opens the archive, identifies the build, locates every member and parses
every container -- which is most of what the procedure below is for.

## Inspecting your IPSW

Two host tools make a real IPSW immediately useful, and deliberately run our
*real* parser against real bytes — so inspection doubles as validation:

```sh
# What is actually inside? (an IPSW is a ZIP)
python tools/ipsw_explore.py firmware/iPhone1,2_3.1.3_7E18_Restore.ipsw

# Pull out one container...
python tools/ipsw_explore.py <ipsw> -x iBoot.n82ap.RELEASE.img3 -o firmware/iboot.img3

# ...and see whether our parser agrees with Apple's actual layout
./build/core/img3dump firmware/iboot.img3

# With a published key, decrypt the payload
./build/core/img3dump firmware/iboot.img3 \
    -k <hexkey> -iv <hexiv> -o firmware/iboot.bin

# Scan a NOR dump for containers
./build/core/img3dump -s firmware/nor.bin
```

`img3dump` prints the raw header bytes before parsing. That matters: a
byte-swapped magic constant once survived a fully green test suite because our
fixtures shared the same mistake as our code. Seeing the real bytes is how that
class of error gets caught.

## Regenerating the three accepted inputs

The emulator accepts exactly three files, checked by size and SHA-256 before
anything is opened; README.md lists them. They are all derived from your own
IPSW, and this is how. Written down because on 2026-07-26 the `firmware/`
directory was found empty, and rebuilding it took an afternoon of rediscovery
for what is really five commands -- the repo had `img3dump` and `unlzss` but
nothing at all for the encrypted, compressed root filesystem.

```sh
S=work/scratch
IPSW=firmware/iPhone1,2_3.1.3_7E18_Restore.ipsw

# kernel.macho -- 7,942,144 bytes
python tools/ipsw_explore.py $IPSW -x kernelcache.release.s5l8900x -o $S/kc.img3
./build/core/img3dump $S/kc.img3 -k <hexkey> -iv <hexiv> -o $S/kc.complzss -copy-tail
./build/core/unlzss $S/kc.complzss firmware/kernel.macho

    -o $S/dt.img3

# rootfs.img -- 433,274,880 bytes

python tools/udif.py extract $S/rootfs.dmg firmware/rootfs.img Apple_HFSX
```

Keys are published per build and per device on The iPhone Wiki, under the build
codename rather than the version -- for 7E18 the page is named for the build,
not for "3.1.3". Pass them on the command line; the repository has no key
loader and no key belongs in a file, a log or a commit. Note that the iPhone1,1
page for the same build carries a *different* RootFS key; the device matters.

Four things that cost time and are easy to get wrong:

- The IPSW member names are not self-describing. `018-6482-014.dmg` is the root
  filesystem; `018-6494-014.dmg` is the restore ramdisk, and an older line in
  docs/debugging.md named the wrong one.
- `unlzss` prints `adler32 check: MISMATCH` and a 42-byte zero-fill notice on
  this kernelcache. That is the documented known discrepancy, it is baked into
  the canonical hash, and it is **not** a failure. It comes from the IMG3's
  last, unaligned block being copied rather than decrypted, which is why the
  kernel line passes `-copy-tail` (img3dump decrypts that block by default, as
  iBoot does and as a device tree's last property needs). The app's importer
  copies a kernelcache's tail and decrypts a device tree's for the same
  reasons.
- The decrypted DMG is a whole disk, 846,324 sectors, including the partition
  map and free space. Only the `Apple_HFSX` partition -- 846,240 sectors --
  reproduces the accepted hash, which is why `udif.py` takes a blkx filter.
- Verify by hash, never by size alone, and write into `firmware/` only after the
  hash matches in scratch. A wrong file there is worse than no file: the
  emulator's own gate will reject it, but only after you have trusted it.

Before committing, verify that firmware remains untracked, for example with
`git status --short` and `git diff --cached --name-only`. Git ignore rules can
be bypassed and do not prevent data from being added under another path.

## Why 3.1.3 specifically

- It's the **last** iPhone OS 3.x release — the most complete 3.x to target.
- Its device keys are **public**, so decryption is a solved problem.
- It runs on the **S5L8900**, the iPhone 2G/3G application processor we emulate.
