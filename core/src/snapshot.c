/*
 * S5LBox — full machine snapshot / restore.  See core/include/snapshot.h for
 * what this promises and why it exists.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * HOW TO ADD A FIELD  (read this before touching a device struct)
 * ===========================================================================
 * Every field of every struct is named EXACTLY ONCE in this file, inside a
 * "visitor" function — snap_cpu(), snap_uart(), snap_timer(), and so on. A
 * visitor does not know whether it is saving, loading, or merely measuring:
 * the F32()/F64()/FB()/FA32()/FBYTES() macros dispatch on io->mode. That is
 * deliberate. It means save and load cannot drift apart, because they are the
 * same list of fields read in the same order.
 *
 * So, to add a field to a device:
 *
 *   1. Add it to the struct in soc.h (or arm.h) as usual.
 *   2. Add ONE line to that struct's visitor below.
 *   3. Update the corresponding number in the STRUCT SIZE GUARDS block and
 *      bump SNAPSHOT_VERSION in snapshot.h.
 *
 * Step 3 is what makes step 2 hard to forget. The guards are _Static_asserts
 * on sizeof() of every struct that is snapshotted. Add a field and the build
 * BREAKS, with a message naming the visitor you have to extend. C gives no way
 * to enumerate a struct's members, so a size guard is the closest thing to
 * "you cannot compile a snapshot that has forgotten a register" — and a
 * forgotten register is a boot that diverges days later.
 *
 * A field that must NOT be snapshotted (a host pointer: m->ram, nor.data,
 * stub.regs, cpu.bus, the bus vtable) is still accounted for: it is listed in
 * the "deliberately not serialised" comment in its visitor. Silence about a
 * field is always a bug.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * FILE FORMAT
 * ===========================================================================
 *   header  (40 bytes, little-endian)
 *       0  char     magic[16]        "S5LBox SNAPSHOT"
 *      16  uint32   version          SNAPSHOT_VERSION, exact match required
 *      20  uint32   header_len       40
 *      24  uint64   payload_len
 *      32  uint64   flags            0
 *   payload (payload_len bytes)      a sequence of sections
 *   trailer (8 bytes)
 *       0  uint64   legacy FNV-1a-style hash over the payload bytes
 *
 *   section:  uint32 tag, uint32 zero, uint64 len, then len bytes
 *   sections, in order: GEOM CPU  MACH RAM  NOR  STUB END
 *
 * The checksum is a TRAILER rather than a header field on purpose: it means
 * the whole file can be written in a single forward pass with no seeking back
 * to patch a header, which keeps this portable to any sink (a file, a socket,
 * an iOS document) and keeps the writer trivial enough to be obviously right.
 * The payload length is known in advance because the visitors can be run in a
 * third "count" mode that measures instead of writing.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * RAM ENCODING — the tradeoff, stated
 * ===========================================================================
 * Guest RAM is up to 512 MB and a naive dump writes all of it every time. The
 * scheme here is the simplest one that is impossible to get wrong: RAM is cut
 * into 4 KB pages and every page is CLASSIFIED BY READING IT — 0 = all zero
 * (nothing stored), 1 = all bytes equal (one byte stored), 2 = anything else
 * (stored verbatim). There is no dirty-page tracking, no write barrier, no
 * cooperation required from the MMU or the bus, and therefore no way for a
 * missed write to silently corrupt a snapshot. The cost is one linear scan of
 * RAM per save, which is a few hundred milliseconds against a boot measured in
 * minutes.
 *
 * That was a deliberate choice over a dirty-bitmap scheme: a dirty bitmap
 * would make saves cheaper and would have to be maintained by every path that
 * writes guest memory (bus_write, s5l8900_load, DMA models yet to be written).
 * One forgotten path there produces exactly the class of silent divergence
 * this feature exists to prevent, and the saving is on the cheap side of the
 * loop. Simple and correct wins.
 *
 * With a 433 MB RAM disk resident in DRAM the classifier does not save much —
 * the file is roughly the size of the live data, as it must be. With a bare
 * kernel boot (no -r) most of DRAM is still zero and the file is small.

 * host-only evidence counters and the transient run-slice yield (56). Like
 * the bus callbacks, snapshot_load preserves this live host policy; none of
 * it belongs to guest state or the stream. The optional active host clock adds
 * another callback/context, seven uint64_t values and transient anchor flag;
 * it follows the same policy. 122192 adds three uint64_t witnesses identifying
 * the last rejected 2D batch inside the already host-only MBX ledger (24).
 * 123312 adds four bounded host-only MBX3D rejection witnesses (4 x 280).
 * They retain transient decoder evidence only and remain outside snap_mach().
 * 123336 adds uart4's two host-peer callbacks and shared context (24), also
 * live host wiring and deliberately outside snap_mach().
 * 125384 adds sixteen bounded accepted-render witnesses (16 x 128) to the
 * same host-only MBX ledger. They classify completed work and retain no guest
 * state, so a restore preserves the destination process's live evidence.
 * 125704 adds eight per-framebuffer target aggregates (8 x 40), likewise
 * host-only, so a short witness ring cannot hide which completed surface later
 * became the active CLCD scanout.
 * 125768 adds host-only audio sink callback/context to s5l8900_t (16) and two
 * s5l_i2s_t host callback/counter fields (2 x 24 = 48), also live host wiring
 * and deliberately outside snap_mach().
 * 125776 adds the host-only CPU backend selection (s5l8900_cpu_backend_t, 4
 * bytes plus tail padding). It is execution policy, not guest state, and is
 * deliberately outside snap_mach().
 * SNAPSHOT_VERSION and the bytes on disk therefore do not move. The size below
 * must be read from the compiler's emitted `.space`, not inferred from source
 * padding. */
