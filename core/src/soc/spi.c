     * a sixteen-octet command work against an eight-deep FIFO: the driver
     * writes sixteen, the first eight shift, the rest wait in the transmit
     * FIFO, and each RXDATA read makes room for one more. Shifting regardless

     * moved 812,340 octets into this port from a channel whose destination is
     * SPI1's TXDATA, and the digitizer received sixteen of them -- eight
     * shifted, eight sat in the transmit FIFO, and every write after that was
     * counted in tx_drops and discarded.
     *
     * That is why this loop does not stall in DMA mode, and it worked: as of
     * run151 the download delivers. `spi1 words 54236 tx-drops 0` -- nothing
     * discarded -- and the device frames all 54,154 octets as ONE HBPP DATA
     * packet. An earlier version of this comment ended "which is why the
     * bootload has never delivered a packet", and that sentence outlived the
     * problem it described by three commits.
     *
     * The bootload still does not COMPLETE, but the reason is no longer here:
     * the driver sleeps after the transfer waiting for spi1's interrupt to run
     * finishTransfer and call commandWakeup. See s5l_spi_irq() below, and
     * docs/multitouch.md 6.14.

     * Silicon does not stall a shifter on a full receive FIFO; it overruns.

    /*
     * AppleMerlotLCD's read helper sends { 0x80 | reg, 0xff }, ignores the
     * first received octet, and returns the second. The enable path repeatedly
     * reads register 0x15 until bit 0 becomes one. The real driver drains that
     * first octet before it queues the dummy clock, so the receive FIFO cannot
     * carry the phase. S5L_SPI_LCD_READ_PENDING does: it is an explicit bit in
     * the already-serialized `cs` byte and survives a checkpoint even when the
     * FIFO is empty.
     *
     * These conditions are exact rather than heuristic. A one-byte command, a
     * write, a different register read, or a transfer with different framing
     * still receives zero.
