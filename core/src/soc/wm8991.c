/*
 * S5LBox — Wolfson WM8991 audio codec, an I2C slave at address 0x1B on i2c0.
 *
 * The register model stays deliberately bounded, exactly as the PMU's does.
 * Register 0 is the identity the driver gates on and is read-only. Register 1
 * bit 5 is the part discriminator and is unimplemented on purpose. Everything
 * else is storage: bytes the guest wrote read back, and a register nobody has
 * written returns zero while being recorded, so a boot tells the next reader
 * which registers the driver actually wanted.
 *
 * See the WM8991 block in soc.h for where every constant and both wire
 * encodings were read out of the shipped firmware.
