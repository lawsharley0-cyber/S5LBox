/*
 * The one design decision worth arguing about is that transfers happen in
 * s5l_pl080_run(), which s5l8900_tick() calls, and NOT inside the store that
 * sets the channel-enable bit.
 *
 * Doing it in the store would work — bus_write() is plain C and would simply
 * recurse — but it would put a whole audio buffer's worth of device writes
 * inside one guest instruction's bus access, interleaved into the device trace
 * between that access's entry and its value, and it would make the DMAC the
 * only device in this machine that can re-enter the bus. Running from the tick
 * costs nothing in latency: s5l8900_tick()'s early-out cannot skip the tick
 * after a device store, because that store sets `level_dirty`.
 *
 * A channel is therefore enabled by one instruction and has completed by the
 * time the next one retires. That is faster than the part — see the burst note
 * in soc.h — but it is the same ORDER the guest observes: the terminal-count
 * status bit and the VIC line it drives are both set before the driver's next
 * load can see them.
