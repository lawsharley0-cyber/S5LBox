/*
 * The two PL080 DMA controllers, and the answer is NEVER for the same reason
 * the SPI controllers' is — but the reasoning has one extra step, because a DMA
 * transfer is the one thing in this machine that looks like it might complete
 * on its own schedule.
 *
 * It does not, here. A channel becomes runnable only when a guest store sets
 * its enable bit, that store sets `level_dirty`, and the very next
 * s5l8900_tick() — which cannot early-out while `level_dirty` is set — runs
 * s5l_pl080_run() to the END of the chain and latches any terminal count. So by
 * the time a core could reach WFI, either the interrupt is already asserted (in
 * which case machine_wait_for_interrupt()'s own pre-check ends the wait before
 * any source is consulted) or there is no transfer in flight at all. There is
 * no future edge to name.
 *
 * That would stop being true the day this model paces transfers against a
 * peripheral's DMA request line instead of completing them in one call, which
 * is exactly the change the burst note in soc.h says has not been made. This
 * entry is where that change would be felt: it would have to start answering
 * S5L_WAKE_AT with the remaining distance, or the machine would fast-forward
 * straight over the completion.
