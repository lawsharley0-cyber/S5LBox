/*
 * S5LBox — ARMv6 interpreter.
 *
 * Scope (M1, in progress): the ARM instruction set (Thumb comes later).
 * Implemented: condition evaluation, the barrel shifter with carry-out,
 * the full data-processing group (AND..MVN) in immediate/register forms with
 * flag setting, branch/branch-with-link, single-data-transfer (LDR/STR, byte
 * and word, pre/post-indexed, writeback), and 32-bit multiply (MUL/MLA).
 *
 * Correctness is the priority for this milestone; the dynarec (see docs) will
 * later reuse this interpreter as its semantic oracle. Everything here is exact
 * ARMv6 behaviour, including r15-reads-as-PC+8 pipeline semantics.

 * Page-crossing unaligned accesses.
 *
 * XNU clears SCTLR.A and sets SCTLR.U (see the SCTLR write at __start+0x16c),
 * so unaligned LDR/STR/LDRH/STRH are legal and the kernel and libSystem use
 * them freely. Translation, however, maps one page: an access whose bytes
 * straddle a 4 KB boundary lives in two pages that are almost never physically
 * adjacent, and it can be permitted in the first and faulting in the second.
 * Translating the base once and issuing one bus access at that PA reads the
 * wrong bytes in the first case and raises no fault at all in the second.
 *
 * A crossing access is therefore split at the boundary and each side is
 * translated on its own. Two deliberate choices:
 *
 *  - ORDER. The pieces are performed in ascending address order, so the piece
 *    that faults first in program order is the one whose fault is reported.
 *    note_abort keeps the first fault, and the VA handed to it is the address
 *    of the byte that actually faulted — for a second-page fault that is the
 *    page-aligned boundary, which is what DFAR must hold. sleh_abort page-
 *    aligns DFAR and maps in that page; reporting the base instead would map
 *    the page the access already had and spin on the same instruction forever.
 *    This is the same rule the LDM/STM path already follows.
 *
 *  - A STORE THAT FAULTS ON ITS SECOND PAGE LEAVES THE FIRST PAGE WRITTEN.
 *    The ARM abort model is base-*register*-restored: it restores Rn and the
 *    destination registers, and says nothing about undoing memory. Hardware
 *    breaks a crossing access into separate bus transactions and has no way to
 *    retract one that has already completed, so on a real ARM1176 the low bytes
 *    are in memory when the abort is taken. Buffering the whole store and
 *    committing it only if both translations succeed would be *stronger* than
 *    the architecture and would hide exactly the class of bug this exists to
 *    expose. It is also safe under re-execution: the handler maps the second
 *    page and restarts the instruction, which rewrites the same low bytes with
 *    the same values. (A load is different, and is already handled: its result
 *    is returned as a value and every caller drops it when abort_pending is
 *    set, so no register moves.)
 *
 * Only the crossing case is split. A non-crossing access — aligned or not —
 * still goes through one translation and one bus call of its natural width, so
 * device registers keep seeing whole-word transactions.
 *
 * LDRD/STRD and LDM/STM need nothing extra: they are built from per-word
 * mem_r32/mem_w32 calls at ascending addresses, so each word that happens to
 * straddle a boundary is split here, in the right order, by itself.
 *
 * The `priv` argument is explicit because the translation-mode load/stores
 * (LDRT/STRT/LDRBT/STRBT, encoded P==0 && W==1) must translate as *unprivileged*
 * even when executing in a privileged mode. That is precisely the mechanism a
 * kernel uses to touch user memory safely, so getting it wrong would let a
 * guest kernel read pages it should fault on. */

/* ============================ the Undefined-instruction discrimination =====
 *
 * Everything this core cannot execute returns ARM_UNDEFINED, which stops the
 * machine and prints the encoding and PC. That loudness is the point: it names
 * the next instruction to implement instead of letting the guest run on
 * fabricated results.
 *
 * There is exactly one family of encodings where stopping is WRONG, because
 * the guest is architecturally supposed to see the Undefined exception and
 * handle it. XNU does not leave VFP on. It clears FPEXC.EN and enables VFP
 * lazily, per thread: the first VFP instruction a thread executes is MEANT to
 * be undefined, and the kernel's handler turns VFP on and re-runs it.
 *
 *   _fleh_undef  0xc0067ff8  MRS sp,spsr; TST sp,#0x20; SUBEQ lr,lr,#4;
 *                            SUBNE lr,lr,#2  -> BL _sleh_undef
 *   _sleh_undef  0xc006c184  reads SPSR.T from the saved state, then matches
 *                            the faulting word against six masks (below). On a
 *                            match it calls _get_vfp_enabled (0xc006994c,
 *                            "VMRS r0,FPEXC; AND r1,r0,#0x40000000"):
 *                              FPEXC.EN == 0 -> _vfp_trap -> _vfp_switch,
 *                                 which sets FPEXC.EN and returns WITHOUT
 *                                 advancing PC, so the instruction re-runs;
 *                              FPEXC.EN != 0 -> falls through to
 *                                 EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL / panic).
 *
 * That second branch is what makes this safe. The kernel itself refuses to
 * treat a VFP encoding as a lazy-enable fault once VFP is already on. So the
 * rule below is not a guess and not a blanket "vector everything":
 *
 *   VFP/SIMD encoding AND VFP currently unavailable -> vector the guest.
 *       Positively identified: this is the lazy-enable path, and the only
 *       thing the guest can do with it is turn VFP on and retry.
 *   VFP/SIMD encoding AND VFP already enabled       -> ARM_UNDEFINED, halt.
 *       We would have to actually compute a floating-point result. Vectoring
 *       here would hand the guest an encoding its own handler classifies as
 *       an illegal instruction, i.e. we would convert "not implemented" into
 *       a SIGILL in launchd and lose the diagnostic entirely.
 *   Anything else                                   -> ARM_UNDEFINED, halt.
 *
 * Because the trap is one-shot per thread, this cannot loop: after the guest
 * enables VFP the retry lands in the second case and stops loudly, naming the
 * exact instruction. Deliberately NOT vectored, though _sleh_undef also
 * recognises them: the ARM/Thumb breakpoints 0xE7FFDEFE / 0xDEFE, which mean
 * the guest has trapped on purpose and we want to see where.

     * bought real progress and then landed on the next member of the same

     * them to trap hides the next stop behind an identical shape.

     *   0x74  SMLALD SMLSLD             the same, accumulating into 64 bits
     *   0x75  SMMUL SMMLA SMMLS         32x32 keeping the TOP word
     *   0x78  USAD8 USADA8              sum of absolute byte differences
     *
     * Ra == 15 is what distinguishes the accumulating form from the plain one
     * (SMLAD/SMUAD, SMMLA/SMMUL, USADA8/USAD8); it is an encoding field, not a
     * register read, so it is tested before reading anything.
     *
     * Products are formed in int64 and narrowed once, so a lane can never carry
     * into its neighbour, and Q is set from whether the full-precision result
     * fitted -- sticky, never cleared here.

     * DATA PROCESSING WITH AN IMMEDIATE, HOISTED, BECAUSE CHAIN DEPTH COSTS.

     * Data processing is the commonest class of ARM instruction there is, and
     * before this it was the LAST arm below -- about twenty-five comparisons
     * deep, where LDR/STR leaves at six. Thumb dispatches through a switch on
     * insn>>12 instead of a chain, and insnbench measured ARM at 0.58 of Thumb
     * on comparable loops. Hoisting this one arm moved that to 0.86: the same
     * loop went 10.95 -> 17.01 M insn/s, about 1.48x, with 54 tests passing.
     *
     * SO DEPTH IS A REAL COST, and that is worth stating carefully because it
     * looks at first like it contradicts a result already recorded in
     * docs/hotpath.md -- "decode scatter is free", measured as a ten-position
     * mixed loop running no slower than a one-position loop. It does not.
     * That experiment varied WHICH arm each instruction leaves by, holding the
     * distances roughly alike; this one changes HOW FAR the commonest arm is.
     * Scatter is free. Depth is not. Both are true.
     *
     * BOTH FORMS ARE HOISTED, immediate and register, because the register
     * form was no better off: it sat behind the whole LDREX/STREX/SWP family,
     * about twelve further comparisons, and `MOV rd, rn, LSL #1` is every bit
     * as common as `ADD rd, rn, #1`.
     *
     * THE GUARD IS EXACT, and it is the ARM decode rule written out rather
     * than an approximation of it. Bits 27-26 == 00 is the data-processing
     * encoding space. Exactly two things live inside it that are not data
     * processing, and each is excluded by name:
     *
     *   - the MISCELLANEOUS space, op1 == 10xx0, i.e. bit24 set with bit23 and
     *     bit20 clear. That is MSR, MRS, BX, BLX(reg), CLZ, the saturating
     *     add/subtracts, the DSP multiplies and BKPT.
     *   - MULTIPLY and EXTRA LOAD/STORE, which are bits 7 and 4 both set, in
     *     the register half only. That is MUL, UMULL, LDRH/STRH/LDRD/STRD,
     *     the exclusives and SWP.
     *
     * Every arm between here and the original catch-all that could match bits
     * 27-25 == 000 was checked to require (insn & 0x90) == 0x90, so none of
     * them can be swallowed. Anything this declines reaches its original arm
     * unchanged, which is what makes the hoist a reordering rather than a
     * reinterpretation.
     *
     * This is a first cut at the shape, not the end of it. The rest of the
     * chain is still linear, and the principled fix is to dispatch on bits
     * 27-25 the way the Thumb decoder dispatches on insn>>12.
