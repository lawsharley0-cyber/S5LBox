/*
 * S5LBox — VFPv2 (the ARM1176JZF-S's VFP11 unit).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY NOW
 * ----------------------------
 * The boot reaches launchd, which issues five syscalls and then executes a VFP
 * instruction. Our lazy-VFP Undefined trap vectors the guest to 0x04; XNU's
 * _sleh_undef (0xc006c184) recognises the encoding and calls _vfp_trap ->
 * _vfp_switch (0xc0069384), which sets FPEXC.EN and then UNCONDITIONALLY
 * executes
 *
 *     VLDMIA r1!, {s0-s31}          ; 0xecb10a20
 *
 * to restore the thread's VFP register file. There is no way past that
 * instruction without a real register file, so real VFP is a requirement the
 * kernel's own code established, not an assumption.
 *
 *
 * WHAT THE HARDWARE IS
 * --------------------
 * VFPv2. 32 single-precision registers s0-s31, aliased onto 16 double-precision
 * registers d0-d15; dN is the pair (s[2N] low word, s[2N+1] high word). There
 * is NO d16-d31 and NO Advanced SIMD/NEON on this part, so every encoding that
 * would name one is refused rather than silently folded onto a register that
 * does exist. Three system registers matter: FPSID (read-only identity),
 * FPSCR (status and control) and FPEXC (the enable, which is the whole lazy
 * per-thread enable mechanism — see the discrimination comment in
 * arm_interp.c).
 *
 *
 * =====================  FLOATING-POINT SEMANTICS  ==========================
 *
 * Arithmetic is the host's C `float` and `double`. That is IEEE-754 binary32
 * and binary64, which is the same format VFPv2 uses, so for round-to-nearest-
 * even every operation implemented here is bit-exact against hardware.
 *
 * MODELLED EXACTLY
 *   - the s/d register file and its aliasing
 *   - +, -, *, /, sqrt, and the four multiply-accumulate forms, each with its
 *     own rounding step (VFPv2's VMLA is NOT fused; see the note at f32_do)
 *   - comparisons, including the unordered case, writing FPSCR.NZCV
 *   - the integer and double/single conversions, with ARM's saturation rules
 *   - the cumulative exception flags IOC / DZC / OFC / UFC / IXC / IDC
 *   - FPSCR.FZ, flush-to-zero, on both the input and the output side; and
 *     FPSCR.DN, default-NaN. These are not optional decoration: dyld runs in
 *     ARM's "RunFast" configuration with FZ set, so the very first
 *     floating-point instruction launchd's dynamic linker executes is already
 *     in a non-default mode.
 *
 * REFUSED, NOT APPROXIMATED. Before any instruction that could be changed by
 * one of these, FPSCR is checked and the instruction TRAPS (ARM_UNDEFINED,
 * with a printed reason) rather than computing a plausible wrong number:
 *
 *   invalid short-vector shapes
 *                      VFP11 implements the legacy VFPv2 short-vector mode.
 *                      Valid LEN/STRIDE combinations execute with circular
 *                      register-bank addressing below. Reserved strides and
 *                      shapes that reuse a register are still refused rather
 *                      than assigned one of the architecture's Unpredictable
 *                      outcomes.
 *   FPSCR.RMode != 0   directed rounding (RP/RM/RZ). Host arithmetic rounds to
 *                      nearest-even. Honouring the other three would mean
 *                      driving the host's rounding mode through <fenv.h>
 *                      fesetround, which without a working #pragma STDC
 *                      FENV_ACCESS the optimiser is entitled to schedule
 *                      around — a wrong float that looks plausible. Only
 *                      instructions that actually round are gated on this;
 *                      VMOV, VABS, VNEG, VCMP, the exact widening conversions
 *                      and VCVT's explicit round-toward-zero form all run in
 *                      any rounding mode, because none of them consult it.
 *   FPSCR trap enables (IOE/DZE/OFE/UFE/IXE/IDE)
 *                      ask the unit to BOUNCE the instruction to support code
 *                      through FPEXC.EX/FPINST. We never enter exceptional
 *                      state, so honouring the request is not possible and
 *                      ignoring it would turn a signalled exception into a
 *                      silently-completed operation. Gated only where an
 *                      exception can actually arise.
 *   the flush-to-zero boundary
 *                      one case inside FZ that the host cannot answer; it is
 *                      detected and refused rather than guessed. See fz_out32.
 *
 * NaN PROPAGATION is ARM's, not the host's: with DN clear, a signalling NaN
 * wins over a quiet one regardless of operand order and is quieted by
 * setting its top fraction bit, and otherwise the first operand wins. The
 * host (x86 SSE, and arm64) prefers the first operand outright, so f32_do and
 * f64_do pick the NaN themselves (FPProcessNaNs) rather than inherit that.
 * This used to be listed below as a deviation; the Unicorn differential test
 * (tools/unicorn_neon_diff.py) found it in a VNMLS and it was fixed.
 *
 * KNOWN DEVIATIONS (all of them, deliberately listed)
 *   1. FPINST / FPINST2 (the bounce registers) are not implemented and
 *      reading them traps: we never bounce, so they have no truthful value.
 *      On the ARM1176 MVFR0 / MVFR1 trap too, because we have no verified
 *      MVFR reading for VFP11 and answering would be inventing a feature
 *      advertisement; XNU 1357 reads neither. The Cortex-A8 profile answers
 *      them with Unicorn's Cortex-A8 values (arm.h, CORTEX_A8_MVFR0).
 *   2. x87 hosts would double-round single-precision arithmetic. Every host
 *      this builds for (x86-64 with SSE, arm64) computes binary32 natively.
 *   3. FPSID reports ARM1176_FPSID (0x410120b4), inherited from the CP15
 *      identity block in arm.h. The implementer, "VFPv2 subarchitecture" and
 *      part fields are certain; the variant/revision nibbles are not
 *      independently verified against an ARM1176JZF-S TRM here, and nothing in
 *      XNU 1357 branches on them. The Cortex-A8 profile's FPSID, 0x410330c0,
 *      is Unicorn's, with the same caveat about its low nibbles.
 *   4. On the Cortex-A8 profile, a short-vector operation whose destination
 *      partially overlaps a source, or that names d16-d31, is refused (see
 *      vfp_short_vector_overlap and NO_D32_VECTOR). Short vectors are
 *      deprecated in ARMv7 and nothing is known to use them there.
 *
 * HOW THE EXCEPTION FLAGS ARE SAMPLED
 *   From the host, via <fenv.h>: feclearexcept before the operation and
 *   fetestexcept after. That is the only way to get UFC and IXC right without
 *   reimplementing rounding. Because GCC does not enable #pragma STDC
 *   FENV_ACCESS, the arithmetic is anchored between the two library calls with
 *   `volatile` staging variables: a volatile access is an observable side
 *   effect and cannot be reordered across a call to an opaque external
 *   function, so the operands are read after the clear and the result is
 *   written before the test. The same anchoring is what forces each rounding
 *   step of VMLA to be materialised, which stops -ffp-contract from fusing the
 *   multiply and the add into an FMA that VFPv2 does not have.
