/* ------------------------------------------------------------ memory map
 *
 * CONFIRMED from the shipped device tree (firmware/devicetree.bin, iPhone1,2
 * 7E18). /arm-io carries two ranges triples — (child, parent, size):
 *
 *     00000000 38000000 08000000     child 0x00000000.. -> phys 0x38000000..
 *     10000000 18000000 10000000     child 0x10000000.. -> phys 0x18000000..
 *
 * so a peripheral's `reg` child address becomes a physical address by adding
 * 0x38000000 in the first window and 0x08000000 in the second. Two independent
 * anchors pin the second window, which is the one that matters here:
 *
 *   /arm-io/vrom  reg {0x18000000,0x10000}  -> phys 0x20000000  (the boot ROM,
 *                 the publicly known S5L8900 secure-ROM address)
 *   /arm-io/amc   reg[1] {0x1a000000,0x2c000} -> phys 0x22000000, and
 *                 firmware/llb.bin carries 0x22000000 at file+0x310 as its own
 *                 link address — the bootrom loads LLB into SRAM there.
 *
 * The resulting physical map, with what is and is not modelled:
 *
 *   0x08000000  DRAM base. 128 MB fitted on an iPhone1,2 (ends 0x10000000).
 *   0x18000000  edram, 0x140000                    NOT MODELLED
 *   0x20000000  vrom (boot ROM), 0x10000           NOT MODELLED
 *   0x22000000  SRAM / AMC window, 0x2c000         NOT MODELLED
 *   0x28000000  <- first physical byte the device tree assigns to NOTHING
 *   0x38000000  arm-io, 0x08000000 — every modelled peripheral lives here
 *
 * The NOR is NOT in this map. The device tree describes it as an SPI slave —
 * /arm-io/spi0/nor-flash, compatible "nor-flash,spi", with a flash-RELATIVE
 * address space (ranges {0,0,0x100000}, which is where S5L8900_NOR_SIZE's 1 MiB
 * comes from) and partitions at flash offsets (nvram @0xfc000, raw-device
 * @0x8000). See S5L8900_NOR_BASE for what our memory window therefore is.
 *
 * The DRAM aperture ceiling: DRAM starts at 0x08000000 and the next thing the
 * SoC decodes is edram at 0x18000000, so no DRAM configuration above 256 MB can
 * be physically real on this part. We allow larger anyway (a RAM-disk root does
 * not fit otherwise); s5l8900_ram_conflict() is what keeps that fiction from
 * becoming a silent alias.

 * {0x4e00000,0x1000} and {0x5200000,0x1000}, and arm-io maps child+0x38000000;
 * run23's non-RAM page report independently attributes live guest traffic at
 * each resulting physical page to AppleS5L8900XSPIController (spi0/spi1) and
 * com.apple.driver.BasebandSPI (spi2).
 *
 * spi2 is the baseband transport: compatible "spi,s5l8900x,baseband", with the
 * SRDY and MRDY handshake lines exposed as GPIO platform functions and DMA
 * channel descriptors pointing at 0x3d200010/0x3d200020.
 *
 * Their device-tree interrupt numbers are NOT three numbers of the same kind,
 * and writing them as "9/10/7" conflated two different interrupt controllers.
 * From the shipped tree:
 *
 *   /arm-io/spi0  interrupts {0x9}      interrupt-parent 0x00b04cc0 = /arm-io/vic
 *   /arm-io/spi1  interrupts {0xa}      interrupt-parent 0x00b04cc0 = /arm-io/vic
 *   /arm-io/spi2  interrupts {0x7,0x2}  interrupt-parent 0x00b05320 = /arm-io/gpio
 *
 * so spi0 and spi1 really are VIC vectors 9 and 10, while spi2's 7 is a GPIO
 * interrupt — a two-cell specifier, /arm-io/gpio having #interrupt-cells 2 —
 * on a controller that is itself a VIC child. It is emphatically not VIC
 * vector 7, which on this SoC is the timer (S5L8900_IRQ_TIMER).
 *
 * spi0 and spi1 are now device models and their two VIC lines are defined and
 * wired (see the SPI section further down). spi2's is deliberately still not:
 * its interrupts are GPIO lines on a controller this machine models as storage,
 * so nothing could route them, and a constant that looks wired but is not is
 * the kind of landmine the GPIO base above was.
 *
 * spi2 therefore remains a declared window rather than a device model. It
 * exists so the traffic is named and stored rather than reading back as the
 * zero an unmapped access returns — run23 caught BasebandSPI writing a
 * configuration block to spi2 and later reading those same four registers back
 * to build a transfer descriptor, which an unmapped window answered with zeros.

/* --------------------------------------------------------------- UART ---
 * Samsung-style UART (as on S3C-family parts). Writing a byte to UTXH
 * transmits it; UTRSTAT reports the transmitter permanently ready, so guest
 * "wait until TX empty" spin loops make progress immediately.
 *
 * TWO INSTANCES, ONE MODEL. uart0 is the kprintf console. uart4 is the port
 * the guest's own /usr/sbin/pppd is pointed at (see S5L8900_UART4_BASE above
 * and docs/networking.md). Transmit is captured on both. Receive exists on
 * both — one model, one FIFO — but only uart4's is wired to a VIC line, and
 * only a host that calls s5l_uart_rx_push() can put a byte in either.
 *
 * REGISTER SEMANTICS, read out of AppleS5L8900XSerial rather than guessed
 * (docs/derivations.md §23.5.1):
 *
 *   UFSTAT (+0x18)  bits[3:0] receive count, bit 8 receive full,
 *                   bits[7:4] transmit count, bit 9 transmit full.
 *                   FIFO depth is 16.
 *   UTRSTAT (+0x10) is NOT a read-only status word. The interrupt filter at
 *                   0xc065eed8 reads it, masks, and writes the result back,
 *                   so the hardware register is write-one-to-clear. Apple's
 *                   own apple_uart_ack_irq() acknowledges the same way: build
 *                   a zero word, set one status bit, store it.
 *
 * THE RECEIVE PATH, and what is modelled versus what is deliberately not.
 *
 * s5l_uart_rx_push() is the ONLY way a byte enters the receive FIFO. Nothing
 * inside core/ ever calls it: a host that has attached a peer calls it between
 * run slices, which is the handoff docs/derivations.md §23.5.1 requires
 * (never from a socket callback — core/ has no threading vocabulary). So on
 * every run without a peer the FIFO is empty at every instant, and the three
 * registers below answer exactly what they answered when this model was
 * transmit-only. That is not a coincidence to be preserved by luck; it is
 * asserted in core/tests/test_uart4.c.
 *
 *   UFSTAT   bits[3:0] = rx_count, bit 8 = rx_count == UART_RX_FIFO. The count
 *            field is four bits and the depth is sixteen, so a full FIFO shows
 *            0 in the field and 1 in the full bit — the standard Samsung
 *            encoding, and the reason the full bit exists at all.
 *   UTRSTAT  bit 0 = "receive data ready" = rx_count != 0. A LEVEL derived from
 *            the FIFO, not a latch: it clears when the guest drains URXH.
 *            bit 4 = the LATCHED receive interrupt, set by an arriving byte and
 *            cleared only by the driver's own store. The two halves of this
 *            register are the subject of the block below.
 *   URXH     dequeues one byte, or answers 0 when empty. Answering anything
 *            else for an empty FIFO would be inventing a byte the host never
 *            sent, which is the one thing these models may not do.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * UTRSTAT IS TWO REGISTERS IN ONE, and which half a bit is in decides this
 * port's whole interrupt behaviour. Apple names every bit in current XNU
 * (pexpert/pexpert/arm/apple_uart_regs.h); Linux names four of the same ones
 * (APPLE_S5L_UTRSTAT_RXTHRESH = BIT(4), RXTO_LEGACY = BIT(3)) and m1n1 agrees:
 *
 *   0x001 receive_buffer_data_ready     0x010 receive_interrupt_status
 *   0x002 transmit_buffer_empty         0x020 transmit_interrupt_status
 *   0x004 transmitter_empty             0x040 error_interrupt_status
 *   0x008 receive_time_out_int_status   0x100 auto_baud_interrupt_status
 *                                       0x200 new_receive_time_out_int_status
 *
 * The first three are LEVELS with a live source behind them — status, which is
 * what a polled console loop reads and what the three lines above describe. The
 * rest are LATCHED interrupt causes: "internal interrupt sources are treated as
 * edge-triggered, even though the IRQ output is level-triggered" (the upstream
 * Linux commit for this variant). They are also exactly the set the driver's
 * own enable mask can hold, which is the second, independent way the two halves
 * were told apart here — read out of the binary, not inferred:
 *
 *   0xc065eecc  the filter, registered as the IOFilterInterruptEventSource
 *               filter action by AppleS5L8900XSerial::start at 0xc065e734.
 *               It computes  r5 = UTRSTAT(+0x10) & this->0x9c , writes r5 back
 *               to +0x10 — THAT WRITE IS THE ACKNOWLEDGE — and then tests ONLY
 *               bits 0x100, 0x40, 0x8, 0x10 and 0x20. Its return value is r6,
 *               and the sole `mov r6, #1` is on the 0x8 branch, so r5 == 0
 *               returns 0.
 *   0xc065f0e4  the only writer of this->0x9c in the whole kext (two stores,
 *               no branch between them). Three boolean arguments contribute
 *               0x18, 0x20 and 0x140 respectively, and each also sets UCON
 *               (+0x04) bits 0x1880, 0x2000 and 0x14000. So the mask can hold
 *               ONLY {0x8,0x10,0x20,0x40,0x100} — bit 0x1 can never enter it —
 *               and every enable sits eight bits above the status bit it gates:
 *               0x1000 enables 0x10, 0x800 enables 0x8, 0x2000 enables 0x20,
 *               0x4000 enables 0x40, 0x10000 enables 0x100. (UCON 0x80 is
 *               rx_time_out_enable, and 0x200's enable is UCON bit 9, outside
 *               the rule — neither matters while neither status bit is ever
 *               asserted.)
 *   0xc018b70a  IOFilterInterruptEventSource::disableInterruptOccurred returns
 *               HERE when the filter returns 0 — before the
 *               provider->disableInterrupt(source) at 0xc018b718. A level that
 *               the filter rejects is therefore never masked.
 *
 * A sweep of 0xc065d000..0xc0662000 in both ARM and Thumb finds exactly two
 * instructions that touch +0x10 at all (the read and the write-back above).
 * NOTHING in this driver tests UTRSTAT bit 0.
 *
 * WHAT THAT COST. This model used to assert bit 0 as the interrupt, i.e. a bit
 * that can never enter the driver's mask: the filter therefore returned 0, the
 * level was never masked, and the VIC re-dispatched it forever. run94: 6,393,888
 * IRQ entries, 44.5% of the run in IRQ mode, disableInterruptOccurred hot in
 * the profile, and one octet of PPP transmitted instead of forty-seven. run80,
 * before the receive path existed: 2,614 and 0.2%. Withholding the line
 * (--no-uart4-rx-irq) restored run80's behaviour with byte delivery unchanged,
 * which is what turned the explanation into a demonstrated cause.
 *
 * SO: 0x10 IS LATCHED, AND NOTHING ELSE IS.
 *
 *   - A byte arriving in the receive FIFO sets pending bit 0x10. Every arrival,
 *     not just the empty->non-empty one: a driver that acknowledges, drains
 *     part of the FIFO and stops would otherwise never be told about the rest.
 *   - Bits 0, 1 and 2 stay LEVELS and are never latched. They are status, the
 *     polled console path depends on them, and bit 0 is what a drain loop tests
 *     to know when to stop.
 *   - A store to UTRSTAT clears exactly the pending bits set in the value. It
 *     cannot touch a level, because no level is stored in the latch.
 *   - The VIC line is (pending & the UCON enables), so a driver that has not
 *     enabled the receive interrupt never sees it. The gate this model once
 *     declined to guess is legible now: 0xc065f0e4 sets the enable and the mask
 *     in the same straight-line instruction stream.
 *   - 0x8, 0x40, 0x100 and 0x200 are NEVER asserted. 0x8's handler reports an
 *     overrun that did not happen; 0x100 runs an auto-baud calculation over
 *     +0x2c, which this model answers 0 from and which is only safe while that
 *     branch is never taken; 0x200 is newer than this kext, which neither tests
 *     it nor enables it.
 *
 * THE ACKNOWLEDGE CLEARS 0x10 EVEN WITH THE FIFO STILL FULL, and that is the
 * load-bearing half of the repair rather than a corner case. The filter's
 * write-back is the only thing that lowers this line: it returns 0 for a receive
 * interrupt (the sole `mov r6, #1` is on the 0x8 branch), so
 * disableInterruptOccurred returns before disableInterrupt() and NOTHING MASKS
 * the line. Re-arming the latch because the FIFO still held data would put the
 * level straight back up against a driver that has already declined to mask it,
 * which is run94 again with a different bit number. The byte is not stranded by
 * this: bit 0 is still a live level, so the driver's drain loop keeps reading
 * until the FIFO is empty, and the next arrival latches a fresh edge.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * FLOW CONTROL is not modelled and does not need to be: uart1 and uart4 carry
 * `no-flow-control`, so AppleS5L8900XSerial's getFlowStatus short-circuits to
 * "asserted" at 0xc065e0bc without ever reading UMSTAT. uart3 is the only port
 * that would have needed it, which is one of the two reasons uart4 was chosen
 * over uart3 — the other being that BTServer ships and contends for uart3.

/*
 * WHERE THE NOR WINDOW IS, AND WHY IT MOVED.
 *
 * This aperture is OURS, not the SoC's. The shipped device tree does not map
 * the NOR into the physical address space at all: it is an SPI slave under
 * /arm-io/spi0 with a flash-relative 1 MiB space (see the memory-map block at
 * the top of this header). We expose it as memory because that is the cheapest
 * honest way to give a guest payload the read/program path an untethered
 * jailbreak needs, without a full SPI protocol model.
 *
 * Because the address is ours, it has to be chosen so that it cannot collide
 * with anything — and 0x24000000, the value this had until now, failed that.
 * It sat inside the DRAM window we actually boot with (-R 512 gives DRAM
 * 0x08000000..0x28000000), and since bus_read tested RAM first, every NOR read
 * silently returned RAM-disk bytes. Nothing faulted and nothing logged.
 * 0x24000000 also had no source: it appears in no shipped artifact — not in the
 * device tree, not in firmware/llb.bin — and the commit that introduced it
 * cited none.
 *
 * 0x28000000 is picked from evidence, and two independent lines land on it:
 *
 *   - it is the first physical byte the shipped device tree assigns to nothing:
 *     /arm-io's second range covers phys 0x18000000..0x28000000 and its first
 *     covers 0x38000000..0x40000000;
 *   - it is the first byte above the largest DRAM the kernel can use. xnu-1357
 *     arm_vm_init fixes virtual_avail at 0xe0000000, so with gVirtBase
 *     0xc0000000 mem_size cannot exceed 512 MB, and DRAM cannot reach past
 *     0x08000000 + 512 MB = 0x28000000.
 *
 * So no RAM aperture this machine will accept can reach it, and no device tree
 * region claims it. Should either of those stop being true, s5l8900_init()
 * refuses to build the machine rather than aliasing anything — see
 * s5l8900_ram_conflict().

 * So the driver identifies its silicon and declines anything it does not

 * at a new site, which is the same discipline the rest of this block follows.

 * tree declares /arm-io/mbx with `reg = {0x03000000, 0x01000000}` -- sixteen

 * whose range is {0x03a8a000, 0x97000}, which is ~10 MB into this aperture and

/* --------------------------------------------- GPIO interrupt controller ---
 * The upper part of the 0x39a00000 page: AppleS5L8900XGPIOIC, a seven-group
 * cascade in front of both VICs. See core/src/soc/gpioic.c for the model.
 *
 * REGISTER OFFSETS ARE RELATIVE TO THE PAGE, NOT TO THE DECODED WINDOW.
 * The window this machine decodes starts at S5L8900_GPIOIC_BASE (0x39a00080),
 * because power.c owns 0x00-0x7F of the same physical page. The driver,
 * however, programs against the page base — its four accessors take an offset
 * from object+0x6c, which the pin-accessor decoding in docs/derivations.md §13.0d
 * resolves to 0x39a00000 — so the constants below are the driver's own and
 * s5l_gpioic_read()/write() take an offset from S5L8900_GPIOIC_PAGE. Rebasing
 * them onto the window would make every one of them differ from the
 * disassembly by 0x80, which is exactly how a register map goes wrong.
 *
 * CONFIRMED from AppleS5L8900XGPIOIC itself, ARM, in this kernelcache:
 *
 *   enable, 0xc05a5678-0xc05a56dc
 *     asr r6, r3, #5        group = line >> 5
 *     and r3, r5, #0x1f     bit   = line & 0x1f
 *     add r1, r8, #0xa0     write 0xA0 + 4*group  <- 1 << bit   (clear stale)
 *     ldr r3, [r1, r6, lsl #2] / orr r2, r3, r5 / str            (shadow |=)
 *     add r1, r8, #0xc0     write 0xC0 + 4*group  <- shadow[group]
 *
 *   disable, 0xc05a5748-0xc05a5788: shadow &= ~(1<<bit), then 0xC0 + 4*group.
 *
 *   init, 0xc05a51a8: shadow[g] = 0 and 0xC0 + 4*g <- 0 for g < [r5+0x78],
 *   which is /arm-io/gpio's `#interrupt-groups` = 7.
 *
 *   initVector, 0xc05a54b8-0xc05a562c (the "configure" this file used to call
 *   it): reads 0xE0 + 4*group and 0x80 + 4*group and writes each back with one
 *   bit replaced — a read-modify-write of two configuration registers, from
 *   bit 0 and bit 1 of the device tree's second interrupt cell respectively.
 *   Bit 2, and bit 0 a second time, also go to software shadows. See below.
 *
 * THE SECOND INTERRUPT CELL, and why this file no longer ignores it.
 *
 * An earlier revision of this header said "every `interrupts` property's second
 * cell is zero, so both registers stay zero for every line this machine can
 * drive". That was only ever true of the lines that had been modelled. The
 * shipped tree uses cells 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 across eleven nodes, and
 * /device-tree/buttons uses 7 and 5 for all five of its lines.
 *
 *   cell bit 0  -> INTTYPE bit (0xE0 + 4*group), 0xc05a55c8-0xc05a55e4,
 *                  AND a software shadow at this+0x8c.
 *   cell bit 1  -> INTLEVEL bit (0x80 + 4*group), 0xc05a55e8-0xc05a5608.
 *   cell bit 2  -> a software shadow at this+0x84, and nothing else.
 *   bits 3..31  -> dead. The only masks applied to the cell in the whole
 *                  function are #5, #1, >>1 &1 and >>2 &1.
 *
 * What those two bits MEAN is settled by the driver itself, twice:
 *
 *   - getInterruptType, 0xc05a429c-0xc05a42b0, stores `cell & 1` as IOKit's
 *     own type value, and kIOInterruptTypeLevel is 1 and kIOInterruptTypeEdge
 *     is 0. So INTTYPE bit 1 == LEVEL-SENSITIVE.
 *   - 0xc05a54fc `and r3, r8, #5` / `cmp r3, #4` calls a panic whose string at
 *     0xc05ac940 is "auto-flip GPIO interrupts must be level-triggered". So
 *     cell bit 2 == AUTO-FLIP, and it is illegal without bit 0. Corroboration:
 *     the shipped tree contains cells 0,1,2,3,5,7 and never 4 or 6 — exactly
 *     the two values that trip that assertion.
 *
 * AUTO-FLIP is how a GPIO button reports both press and release with one line.
 * handleInterrupt at 0xc05a4358-0xc05a4390 reads the this+0x84 shadow and, for
 * an auto-flip line, does `eor r2, r0, r6` on the INTLEVEL word and writes it
 * back — inverting that line's polarity bit — BEFORE dispatching the child
 * handler and BEFORE acknowledging. So the next interrupt is the opposite
 * transition. That shadow is read nowhere else in the class.
 *
 * ACKNOWLEDGE ORDER IS NOT UNIFORM, and it is decided by the this+0x8c shadow,
 * i.e. by cell bit 0: an EDGE line is acknowledged at 0xc05a4354, before the
 * child handler; a LEVEL line at 0xc05a4418, after it returns. handleInterrupt
 * then re-reads 0xA0 + 4*group and loops until it reads zero (0xc05a42fc-
 * 0xc05a4424), highest set bit first, and it never masks with INTEN.
 *
 * These were measured as well as read. run86's group-1 registers settle at
 * INTTYPE 0x00002f00 and INTLEVEL 0x00002900 — five lines configured, and the
 * three whose cell is 7 have their INTLEVEL bit set while the two whose cell is
 * 5 do not — and group 5 settles at INTTYPE 0x00000000, INTLEVEL 0x00000004,
 * which is /arm-io/spi0/lcd0's `interrupts {162, 2}`: bit 0 clear, bit 1 set.
 * Four groups, six distinct cell values, no disagreement.
 *
 * The seven cascade lines are /arm-io/gpio's own `interrupts`, read out of the
 * shipped tree: {0x21,0x20,0x1f,0x03,0x02,0x01,0x00} = {33,32,31,3,2,1,0},
 * one per group in array order. GROUP 4 IS THEREFORE VIC LINE 2, and the
 * multi-touch ATN — /arm-io/spi1/multi-touch `interrupts {0x9b,0}`, i.e. line
 * 155 — is group 4 bit 27, which is precisely the 0x08000000 run59 measured in
 * this controller's group-4 enable register. "GPIO 155" is a line index on
 * this controller with a stride of 32, NOT a pin number: do not compute it as
 * group*8+bit, and do not put 155 in a wake-source entry, because
 * wake_line_enabled() rejects anything at or above 32*S5L8900_VIC_COUNT and
 * would silently answer "cannot wake".

 * the level afterwards finds the pin already back where it started.
 *

 * So this is not a device model in the sense mtz2.c is; it is the BOARD, and
 * everything below is a statement about wiring rather than about registers.
 *
 * /device-tree/buttons, read out of the shipped 40,544-byte tree:
 *
 *   device_type      'buttons'          compatible 'buttons'
 *   interrupt-parent  -> /arm-io/gpio   (the interrupt controller above)
 *   button-names     'hold\0menu\0volup\0voldown\0ringerab\0'
 *   interrupts       {45,7} {40,7} {41,5} {42,5} {43,7}

 *   function-button_voldown  {gpio, 'GPIO', 0x1602, 0x00000000}
 *   function-button_ringerab {gpio, 'GPIO', 0x1603, 0x00010000}
 *   function-wake_button_hold{pmu,  'STAT', 0x00000100}
 *
 * `button-names` and `interrupts` are parallel arrays — the driver walks the
 * names in order and asks its provider for interrupt index i (0xc065a6b0,
 * `interruptEventSource(this, action, provider, i)`) — so BUTTON_HOLD is index
 * 0 and takes line 45, and this file's order is the tree's order for exactly
 * that reason. A table in a different order would still compile.
 *
 * ALL FIVE ARE SoC GPIOs, INCLUDING POWER/HOLD AND THE VOLUME KEYS. The PMU is
 * involved only through `function-wake_button_hold`, a 'STAT' function on
 * /arm-io/i2c0/pmu that AppleM68Buttons resolves once at start (0xc065a6a4,
 * stored at this+0x90+4i) and reads only in its power-state path (0xc065a0c8)
 * to answer "did this button wake us". It is NOT the ordinary press/release
 * path. The machine-level s5l8900_set_button() wrapper models it only while
 * the PMU has put the application processor into standby.
 *
 * WHICH LEVEL IS "PRESSED". This is the number that had to be right, because a
 * wrong one reads as a button held down forever. Two independently decoded
 * fields agree, and a third pin whose polarity was already known corroborates.
 *
 *  1. The fourth word of a `function-*` property is a platform-function
 *     argument block. AppleS5L8900X's apply routine reads BYTE 1 of it and
 *     uses it, and only it, as a polarity: the read path at 0xc05a45d8 is
 *          ldrb r3,[r3,#0xd] / eor r3,r3,#1 / eor r3,r3,r0
 *     over the raw level from getPinLevel (0xc05a4474, which is soc.h's
 *     documented `(reg >> bit) & 1` accessor on the PIN page), and the write
 *     path at 0xc05a459c is the identical pair before setPinOutput. So byte 1
 *     == 1 means ACTIVE HIGH and 0 means ACTIVE LOW, and what a child sees is
 *     already normalised to "1 == asserted".
 *     CORROBORATION: /arm-io/spi1/multi-touch's `function-reset` is
 *     0x00010001, byte 1 == 0 — and that pin was independently established as
 *     ACTIVE LOW from the driver's own reset behaviour long before this byte
 *     was decoded. /arm-io/spi0/lcd0's `function-reset` 0x00000001 agrees too.
 *  2. Every one of these five lines is configured LEVEL-sensitive with
 *     AUTO-FLIP (cell 7 and cell 5 both have bits 0 and 2 set). A level line
 *     that is asserted at rest is an interrupt storm at boot, so the INTLEVEL
 *     bit the guest programs must be the OPPOSITE of the resting level. Guest
 *     programs INTLEVEL 1 for hold and menu, 0 for volup and voldown
 *     (measured: group 1 settles at 0x00002900) — which says hold and menu
 *     rest LOW and the volume keys rest HIGH.
 *
 * (1) and (2) are derived from different words of a different property by
 * different code and they give the same answer for all four momentary keys.
 *
 *              pin      line  cell  INTTYPE  INTLEVEL  polarity  PRESSED  rest
 *   hold      0x1605     45     7    level      1      high        high    low

 * WHAT THE GUEST DOES WITH THEM. AppleM68Buttons never polls. An interrupt on
 * any of the five arms a single 14 ms one-shot timer (0xc065a31c, the literal

 * active-low platform polarity above, the Phone Mute value it dispatches is
 * the RAW pin level: pin high == muted. That composition is established; which
 * physical position of the slider drives the pin high is NOT, and this model
 * does not claim it. The host API therefore names the two positions after what
 * the guest is told (S5L_BUTTONS_RINGER_MUTED), not after a silkscreen.
 *
 * The rest position chosen for the ringer here is the one that asserts NOTHING
 * at boot, i.e. pin low, unmuted. A rest position that asserted its level line
 * would hand the guest an interrupt it did not ask for before its driver has
 * finished starting, and "the machine boots quietly" is worth more than a

 *     PREVIOUS transition. Accepting now would collapse a press and a release
 *     into a single pending bit and the guest would observe neither, which is
 *     strictly worse than being told no.

/* ------------------------------------------- WM8991 audio codec (i2c0) ---
 * The Wolfson codec `AppleWM8991Audio` drives. Everything below is read out of
 * the shipped device tree and the shipped kext; nothing is taken from a
 * datasheet, because we have none for this part and a guessed register map is
 * indistinguishable from a correct one until the boot diverges.
 *
 * WHERE IT IS. `/arm-io/i2c0/audio0`, device_type `audio-control`, compatible
 * `audio-control,wm8991`, `reg = {0x1b, 0x9c4, 0, 0}` — seven-bit address
 * 0x1B on i2c0, exactly the shape the PMU node uses for 0x73. Its sibling
 * `/arm-io/i2s0/audio0` is `audio-data,wm8991`, which is what puts this codec's
 * sample path on i2s0 rather than i2s1 (i2s1's child is `audio-data,baseband`).
 *
 * THE WIRE PROTOCOL, from AppleEmbeddedAudio's own transfer helpers:
 *
 *   read  (0xc053ff94): one index byte out, then TWO bytes in, and the value is
 *         assembled MSB-first — `ldrb r3,[sp,#0xe]; ldrb r0,[sp,#0xf];
 *         orr r0,r0,r3,lsl #8` at 0xc0540030..0xc0540038. The first byte on
 *         the wire is bits [15:8]. On failure this is the helper that prints
 *         `%s: I2C register read failed (%#x): %s` (0xc0548048) — the exact
 *         format string behind today's `(0): device error`, with `%#x` of zero
 *         rendering as a bare `0`.
 *   write, wide form (0xc0540050): index byte, then the 16-bit value MSB-first
 *         — `lsr r3,r5,#8; strb r3,[sp,#0xe]; strb r5,[sp,#0xf]`. Three bytes
 *         after the address.
 *   write, packed form (0xc0540108): the classic Wolfson two-wire encoding,
 *         seven-bit register and nine-bit datum in two bytes —
 *         `and r1,r1,#0x7f; and r3,r2,#0x100; lsl r1,r1,#1;
 *          orr r1,r1,r3,lsr #8` gives byte0 = (reg << 1) | value[8], and
 *         byte1 = value[7:0]. Two bytes after the address.
 *
 * THIS codec uses the WIDE form: `AppleWM8991Audio::writeCodecRegister`
 * (0xc068b168) dispatches to the wide helper and nothing in the kext reaches
 * the packed one, which belongs to the WM8758 sibling driver. Both are
 * implemented here anyway, because the BYTE COUNT distinguishes them for free
 * and a model that silently misreads a two-byte transfer as a truncated
 * three-byte one would be wrong in a way no test would catch: one byte after
 * the address is a pointer-only write — the stock controller's read setup,
 * which must not be mistaken for a register store — two bytes is the packed
 * form, three the wide form. The counts are distinct, so nothing here has to
 * guess which encoding it is looking at, and any other length is refused and
 * counted rather than interpreted.
 *
 * WHICH REGISTERS EVER REACH THIS MODEL AT ALL. Only six.
 * `AppleWM8991Audio::readCodecRegister` (0xc068b1b4) gates every read on the
 * bitmap 0x0084000f held at 0xc068b21c — `ands r3, r2, r3, lsl r1` over
 * `1 << reg` — and serves everything else out of a RAM shadow the driver seeds
 * from its own default table at 0xc0691030. Set bits {0,1,2,3,18,23} means
 * registers 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x12 and 0x17 are the complete set whose
 * readback this model can affect. That default table is NOT reproduced here:
 * its 63 entries are the driver's belief about an untouched part, the driver
 * never needs the device to supply them, and copying them in would be the full
 * register map this model deliberately does not invent. Its entry 0 is 0x8990,
 * which is a second independent confirmation of the identity literal.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY VALIDATED. The identify method at 0xc068b078 (codec vtable
 * slot +0x178, which calls its own superclass at the same slot first):
 *
 *   - reads register 0 and compares it against the literal at 0xc068b124.
 *     That word is `0x00008990`, confirmed by reading the file at the byte
 *     level, and 0xc068b0ac is the ONLY instruction anywhere in the kernelcache
 *     that loads it. A mismatch takes `movne r5,#0` and the probe fails. This
 *     is the one hard gate.
 *   - then writes register 1 bit 5, reads register 1 back, and tests bit 5.
 *     This is NOT a second gate: both branches return the same success value.
 *     It selects a NAME. `strbeq` stores 0 when the bit reads back clear and
 *     the getter at 0xc068b044 turns 0 into "WM8991" (0xc0690158) and 1 into
 *     "WM1817" (0xc0690150). So a part whose R1 bit 5 sticks is reported as a
 *     WM1817. The shipped device tree says `wm8991` in both of its audio nodes
 *     and contains no occurrence of "1817" at all, so on THIS board bit 5 must
 *     read back clear, and this model leaves it unimplemented: writes to it are
 *     discarded and reads return zero. The flag it sets is loaded from `this`
 *     at ten further sites in the kext, so this is not a cosmetic choice.
 *
 * THE ONE PLACE THIS MODEL INFERS RATHER THAN OBSERVES, stated plainly because
 * it is the only one. The codec's GPIO configure path contains a poll at
 * 0xc068d4ac..0xc068d514 with NO timeout, NO iteration cap and no IODelay or
 * IOSleep in its body:
 *
 *     rmw(0x17, 0x1000, level << 12);            // 0xc068d44c, before the loop
 *     do {  write(0x17, computed);               // 0xc068d4cc
 *           write(0x12, last & 0x0000efff);      // 0xc068d4e8 — clears bit 12
 *           v = read(0x12);                      // 0xc068d4fc
 *     } while ((v & ~arg & 0x1000) != (level << 12));   // 0xc068d50c
 *
 * The driver forces bit 12 of register 0x12 CLEAR every time it writes that
 * register, and then waits for that same bit to read back as `level`. So it
 * cannot be waiting for storage: on a part where 0x12 bit 12 held what was last
 * written, `level == 1` would spin forever. The only self-consistent reading is
 * that 0x12 bit 12 is a read-only status reflecting the request made through
 * 0x17 bit 12 — a pin commanded in one register and observed in another. This
 * model implements exactly that and nothing more: bit 12 of register 0x12 is
 * not storage, it mirrors bit 12 of register 0x17.
 *
 * That is an inference from the poll's own structure, not a measurement, and it
 * is deliberately the narrowest one that makes a loop whose only exit condition
 * is the device terminate. It is counted, so a boot can say how often it
 * mattered. Every other bit of both registers is ordinary storage.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT MODELLED. Everything else. There is no volume, routing, clocking,
 * power-sequencing or mute behaviour here, and no register has a reset value
 * other than zero — because none was established. Unwritten registers read zero
 * and are recorded, exactly as the PMU does, so the next reader learns which
 * registers the driver actually wanted from a boot rather than from a guess.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------- I2S ---
 * The two S5L8900 I2S controllers. Their windows are derived at the top of this
 * header; this is the register model, and it is deliberately the smallest one
 * in this file because the driver is the smallest consumer in the kernelcache.
 *
 * WHY IT IS THIS SMALL. AppleS5L8900XI2SController funnels every window access
 * through two three-instruction accessors, and only one of them is ever
 * reached:
 *
 *     readRegister   0xc05a3c84   ldr r3,[r0,#0x78]; ldr r0,[r1,r3]; bx lr
 *     writeRegister  0xc05a3c90   ldr r3,[r0,#0x78]; str r2,[r1,r3]; bx lr
 *
 * `readRegister` has NO caller anywhere in the kernelcache. Four independent
 * checks agree: its address occurs as an aligned word exactly once in the whole
 * file (its own vtable slot 0xc05ad888); no ARM or Thumb BL/BLX targets it; no
 * `ldr pc,[Rn,#0x3c0]` dispatch exists with any base but PC; and slot +0x3c0 is
 * a virtual this class INTRODUCES — its parent AppleARMIISController's vtable
 * ends at +0x3ac — so no other kext can reach it through a base pointer even in
 * principle. The class therefore contains exactly one MMIO load instruction in
 * the entire image, and that instruction is dead code.
 *
 * That is what makes an unread window safe rather than merely convenient: there
 * is no status bit, no reset acknowledge, no FIFO level and no revision check
 * for a fabricated zero to answer wrongly, because nothing asks. It also
 * independently explains the zero MMIO traffic run62's census recorded on
 * 0x3ca00000 and 0x3cd00000 while both controllers started and published.
 *
 * THE SEVEN OFFSETS, enumerated from every writeRegister dispatch site:
 *
 *   configure()     0xc05a3820  +0x00 (cfg|1), +0x40, +0x04 (cfg|1), +0x30,

 *   stop()          0xc05a3ad0  +0x08 (0), +0x34 (0)
 *
 * The values at +0x00/+0x04/+0x30/+0x40 come from a caller-supplied
 * AppleARMIISCommand, never from a register read. NO SEMANTICS ARE CLAIMED for
 * any of the seven. The pattern at +0x08/+0x34 (0 configured, 6 running, 0
 * stopped) is consistent with a per-direction enable, and bit 0 is forced set
 * at +0x00/+0x04, but "consistent with" is not "established", and this model
 * stores rather than interprets. Anything outside the seven is counted and its
 * offset recorded, exactly as on I2C and SPI, so a driver that grows a new
 * register names it in a census instead of vanishing into a stub.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. Not a sample path. The PCM FIFOs live at +0x10 and +0x38
 * and the CPU never touches them: the device tree hands their PHYSICAL
 * addresses (0x3ca00010/0x3ca00038, 0x3cd00010/0x3cd00038 — already absolute in
 * the `dma-channels` blob, not arm-io relative) straight to the PL080, which is
 * not modelled. No clock, no frame timing, no interrupt. i2s0 carries the
 * WM8991 (`/arm-io/i2s0/audio0`, `audio-data,wm8991`); i2s1 carries the
 * baseband voice path (`audio-data,baseband`), which is why both windows exist
 * here even though only one of them belongs to the codec.

/* --- the two FIFOs, named rather than merely counted --------------------
 * The paragraph above says the FIFOs live at +0x10 and +0x38 and that the CPU
 * never touches them. Both halves of that remain true and neither is weakened
 * here: nothing below stores anything, nothing below changes what a guest
 * access does, and a CPU access to either offset is still counted as the
 * off-map anomaly it is. What is added is a NAME for the two offsets and the
 * evidence for which of them carries samples OUT, so a capture that taps them
 * cites the device tree instead of a constant somebody typed.
 *
 * WHERE THE TWO OFFSETS COME FROM. /arm-io/i2s0's own `dma-channels`, 64 bytes,
 * read as two 32-byte entries of little-endian words:
 *
 *   [0] 0x00000800 0x00249000 0x00000000 0x3ca00010 0 0 0 0
 *   [1] 0x00001042 0x00249000 0x3ca00038 0x00000000 0 0 0 0
 *
 * and /arm-io/i2s1's is the same shape over its own window:
 *
 *   [0] 0x00000884 0x00249000 0x00000000 0x3cd00010 1 0 0 0
 *   [1] 0x000010c6 0x00249000 0x3cd00038 0x00000000 1 0 0 0
 *
 * Words 2 and 3 are a pair with exactly one side filled in; the zero side is
 * the memory end, which only exists once a transfer is set up. In all four
 * entries +0x10 occupies the LATER of the two slots and +0x38 the EARLIER, so
 * the two channels are opposite directions -- that much is established, twice,
 * independently per controller.
 *
 * WHICH ONE IS TRANSMIT IS AN INFERENCE, not an established fact, and the
 * distinction matters enough to spell out. It rests on reading the pair as
 * (source, destination), which makes +0x10 a destination and therefore the
 * transmit side. Word 0 is consistent with that -- the +0x10 channel carries
 * 0x0800 and the +0x38 one 0x1000, a single differing bit, while their low
 * bits are peripheral identifiers that shift by the same +0x84 from i2s0 to
 * i2s1 -- but "consistent with" is not "established", exactly as for the seven
 * registers above. Nothing here depends on the inference being right: a capture
 * records CPU STORES, and a store is data leaving the CPU whichever FIFO it
 * lands in, so a reversed reading would mislabel a stream rather than lose one.

 * The two S5L8900 SPI controllers AppleS5L8900XSPIController drives. Their
 * windows and VIC lines are derived at the top of this header; what follows is
 * the register model, and why it is a model rather than the stub it replaces.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. AppleMultitouchZ2SPI::finishStarting() @0xc0442670 probes
 * the touch controller through isInHBPP() @0xc0441008, which issues one 16-byte
 * full-duplex transfer on spi1 — `provider->vtbl[0x368](tx, 16, rx, 16, 0)` at
 * 0xc04410a4 — and then blocks at 0xc05a6d80 in IOCommandGate::commandSleep(
 * event, 0): the two-argument form, so no deadline. It loops there while its
 * done flag is clear (0xc05a6d8c) until the SPI completion interrupt sets the
 * flag and calls commandWakeup. Against a storage stub that interrupt can never
 * arrive, so the kext has been asleep since the first time it ran. run59
 * measured the shape of the stall exactly: spi1 `r=0 w=19`, which is the
 * driver's eleven configuration writes plus the eight bytes it pushes into an
 * eight-deep transmit FIFO before it starts and sleeps. `r=0` is the proof that
 * the interrupt handler never ran even once.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS. The interrupt routine is the FILTER half of an
 * IOFilterInterruptEventSource (registered at 0xc05a7150; body at 0xc05a6688,
 * action finishTransfer at 0xc05a6840). It reads STATUS and, when the
 * receive-FIFO level field is zero, returns false at 0xc05a66e4 having
 * acknowledged nothing — and a filter returning false does not schedule its
 * action, so finishTransfer never runs and nothing calls commandWakeup.
 * Raising the line with an empty receive FIFO therefore reproduces the
 * unbounded sleep exactly rather than ending it, which is why s5l_spi_irq()
 * requires a byte the filter can actually drain.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. No clock rate, DMA channel, chip-select edge or bit-order
 * behaviour is emulated. The dividers at 0x30/0x38 are stored and never turned
 * into time: a word is shifted the instant the guest stores it, exactly as an
 * I2C transfer completes inside its command store.

 *
 *     ldrh r1, [sp, #0x36]        <- the announced report length

 *     ...  ldr pc, [ip, #0x4c0]
 *
 * Slot 0x4c0 is 0xc0441ba0, and it opens `mvn r3, #0x18 / strb r3, [r2]` —
 * 0xE7. (Slot 0x4bc at 0xc0441ea4 is `mvn r3, #0x19` = 0xE6, and the two
 * control WRITES beside them are 0x4c4 -> 0xE4 and 0x4c8 -> 0xE5. Slot 0x4d0
 * in the same block is 0xc0441008, isInHBPP, which is what fixes the vtable
 * base at 0xc0449f40.)
 *
 * BOTH STAGES, from 0xc0441ba0. `length` is the announced length, in r1:
 *
 *   STAGE 1, sixteen bytes (`mov r5,#0x10` at 0xc0441be8, handed to the SPI
 *   entry at 0xc0441c70):
 *       tx[0]      = 0xE7
 *       tx[1]      = report id
 *       tx[2]      = 0
 *       tx[3..4]   = LE16 length          <- the host states the frame size
 *       tx[14..15] = LE16 sum16(tx, 5)    <- FIVE bytes, `mov r1,#5` 0xc0441bf0
 *   The answer is not examined: 0xc0441cb4 tests only the SPI call's return.
 *
 *   STAGE 2, length + 5 bytes (`add r5, r8, #5` at 0xc0441d18):
 *       tx[2]              = 1
 *       tx[14..15]         = 0            (0xc0441d10/0xc0441d1c)
 *       tx[length+3..+4]   = the STAGE 1 checksum, moved rather than recomputed
 *   which is the same stale-checksum quirk the short form has at 0xc0441ff8 —
 *   there it needs no move because length 11 already puts it at [14..15].
 *
 * WHAT THE ANSWER MUST SATISFY, at 0xc0441da0-0xc0441e08, and it is two things:
 *       rx[0] == tx[0]                                   (0xc0441db0)
 *       LE16(rx[length+3..length+4]) == sum16(rx, length+3)
 * and then `memcpy(desc + 1, rx + 3, length)` at 0xc0441e24 with
 * `desc->length = length` at 0xc0441e2c. So the payload is rx[3 .. 3+length),
 * the checksum is the two bytes after it, and at length 11 every one of those
 * positions is the short form's. One rule serves both, which is why mtz2.c has
 * no second composer.

 *             answer sets this+0x1bc — see 0xc0440560)
 *   tx[1]   = this+0x7e6, the toggle              (1 initially, flipped 1<->2
 *             after every successful data read at 0xc0443100)
 *   tx[2]   = 0
 *   tx[14..15] = LE16 sum16(tx, 14)
 * and the answer must satisfy, at 0xc0442554-0xc04425c0:
 *   (rx[0] & 0xF0) == 0xE0
 *   LE16(rx[14..15]) == sum16(rx, 14)
 *   L = rx[1] | rx[2] << 8            <- the caller's out-parameter
 * L == 0 is NOT an error. The caller tests it at 0xc043bf90 / 0xc04430bc and
 * simply stops, so an idle device answers one 16-byte transfer and is done.
 *
 * DATA READ, tx[2] == 1, L + 5 bytes (0xc04430c4, `add r1,r1,#5`), same
 * tx[0..1], and the transmit checksum moves to tx[len-2..len-1] because it is
 * stored relative to the transfer length (0xc0441254/0xc044126c) — it is still
 * sum16 of only the first FOURTEEN bytes. The answer is checked at
 * 0xc044130c-0xc04413b8:
 *   rx[0]            == 0xEB (or 0xEA), and 0xEB additionally requires the
 *                       driver's this+0x1bc to be non-zero
 *   (rx[0]+rx[1]+rx[2]+rx[3]+rx[4]) & 0xFF == 0
 *   L2 = rx[2] | rx[3] << 8, and L2 of 0 or 2 means "no payload", checked
 *        BEFORE the payload checksum
 *   payload          = rx[5 .. 5 + L2 - 3], i.e. L2 - 2 bytes
 *   LE16(rx[len-2..len-1]) == sum16(payload, L2 - 2)
 * The payload checksum's position comes from the TRANSFER length and the
 * payload's own length comes from the EMBEDDED L2, so the two agree only when
 * L2 == L: payload occupies [5, L+3) and the checksum [L+3, L+5).
 *
 * Then `this->v[0x414](payload, L-2)` at 0xc0441400 -> 0xc04389fc, which reads
 * ONE byte of the payload — `payload[0] == 0x50` is diverted to v[0x418]
 * (0xc043d1ac, a separate 8-byte status record) — and otherwise tail-calls
 * v[0x3c4] = 0xc043c31c, which fans the buffer out to up to 32 subscribed
 * clients through 0xc043d684: `IODataQueue::enqueue(payload, (len+3) & ~3)`.
 * So a touch frame's first payload byte must not be 0x50.

 * for the FIRST only. Both dmac nodes are under 0x08000000 and therefore in it,
 * giving the two bases below; a node above 0x10000000 would need the second.
 * Both interrupt-parent to /arm-io/vic, and both numbers are under 32, so both
 * lines are VIC0's — unlike i2s0/i2s1, whose `interrupts` are GPIO-IC numbers
 * and therefore have deliberately no constant here.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. `dma-channels` on /arm-io/i2s0 hands the PL080 the
 * absolute physical addresses 0x3ca00010 and 0x3ca00038 — the I2S transmit and
 * receive FIFOs. The CPU never touches them: the audio path is DMA-driven end
 * to end, so with no controller here not one sample could ever leave the guest,
 * however correct the codec and the I2S window were. The driver allocates ten
 * channels on every boot, printing a physical LLI-buffer address for each.
 *
 * AND WHAT THE FIRST BOOT WITH IT MEASURED, which is narrower than the sentence
 * above deserves. Allocating a channel touches no register: _initDMAChannel
 * (0xc070f01c) only allocates the 4 KiB linked-list buffer and copies the
 * device tree's 32-byte `dma-channels` entry into a software record. The
 * registers are first touched when a COMMAND is queued, and in a boot to
 * userspace at 900M instructions the whole 0x38200000 page saw one read and two
 * writes — byte for byte what run89-base's census recorded with no model here at
 * all, and that run went to 3.55 BILLION instructions. 0x39900000 saw nothing.
 * So this controller is now correct, decoded, and idle: nothing in this boot
 * ever calls startDMACommand, and the blocker for guest audio has moved
 * upstream of the DMA controller.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *
 * Everything marked "read" below was read out of AppleARMPL080DMAC in the
 * shipped 7E18 kernelcache (kext __TEXT 0xc070e000..0xc070fe28, ARM mode), not
 * out of the published PrimeCell TRM. The driver reaches the register file
 * through exactly two out-of-line virtuals, which is what makes the census
 * complete rather than merely thorough:

 *   vptr+0x3a4  0xc070ecd0  read32 (this, off)          -> ldr r0,[off, base]
 *   vptr+0x3a8  0xc070ecdc  writeMasked(this, off, val, mask)
 *
 * writeMasked skips the read-modify-write when mask == 0xffffffff, so a full
 * write never reads first. Every call site was enumerated: 10 reads and 17
 * writes, resolving to these offsets and no others.
 *
 *   0x000  read   at 0xc070f16c, the interrupt filter's first act.
 *   0x008  write  at 0xc070f18c, the value just read from 0x000, mask ~0.
 *   0x030  write  1 at 0xc070ed7c and 0 at 0xc070ee90 (power on / off).

 * The channel stride and count are read, not assumed: the power-on path at
 * 0xc070edb8 clears Configuration and LLI for r5 = 0x130, 0x150 ... 0x1f0 after
 * doing channel 0 explicitly at 0x110/0x108, which is eight channels 0x20
 * apart. startDMACommand refuses an index above 7 (`cmp r1,#7; bhi`, 0xc070e0f8)
 * and the channel-allocator at 0xc070e830 clamps to 7 and walks a 100-byte
 * per-channel record with `ldr r0,[ip],#-0x64`.
 *
 * The bit positions are read the same way:
 *
 *   Configuration bit 0  (E)      0xc070e950 `tst r0,#1` decides whether the
 *                                 channel still needs programming; 0xc070e9d0
 *                                 starts it with template | 0x8001.
 *   Configuration bit 15 (ITC)    the 0x8000 half of that same 0x8001.
 *   Configuration bit 17 (A)      0xc070efc8 `tst r0,#0x20000` spins in an
 *                                 UNBOUNDED loop until it clears — this model
 *                                 must never leave it set, or the guest hangs.
 *   Configuration bit 18 (H)      0xc070ef04 halts with template | 0x40001,
 *                                 the literal at 0xc070ef68 — enable AND halt
 *                                 in one store, so a model that reads bit 0 as
 *                                 "go" would start the transfer this write
 *                                 exists to stop.
 *   Configuration [13:11] flow    0xc070e45c rewrites exactly that field in the
 *                                 software template per direction: 0x800 out,
 *                                 0x1000 in — and 0xc070e444 skips the rewrite
 *                                 entirely for direction 0, leaving whatever
 *                                 the device tree supplied.
 *   Control [11:0] size           0xc070e738 and 0xc070fb7c mask a read-back
 *                                 with 0xfff to get the remaining count.
 *   Control bit 26 (SI)           0xc070e4bc ORs 0x4000000 when direction & 2.
 *   Control bit 27 (DI)           0xc070e4c4 ORs 0x8000000 when direction & 1.
 *   Control bit 31 (I)            0xc070fbfc sets 0x80000000 on the LAST LLI
 *                                 only, and 0xc070fb94 reads it back with
 *                                 `lsr #0x1f`.
 *   Control [20:18]/[23:21] width 0xc070e14c picks >>21 for direction 1 and
 *                                 >>18 otherwise, then &7.
 *
 * The linked-list item is four words {SrcAddr, DestAddr, Next, Control} at
 * +0x0/+4/+8/+0xc: the builder at 0xc070fba0 stores exactly those, and the
 * reader at 0xc070fb3c takes Next from +8 and Control from +0xc. `bic ...,#3`
 * at 0xc070e718, 0xc070e750 and 0xc070f954 strips the AHB master-select field
 * in the low two bits — on the three read-backs whose value is used as an
 * ADDRESS. The fourth, 0xc070e8f0, is left unmasked because 0xc070e8f8 only
 * compares it against zero.
 *
 * WHERE APPLE'S PART MATCHES THE PUBLISHED SPEC. Everywhere the driver goes.
 * Nothing in the disassembly contradicts the PL080 TRM's map, and the DT's own
 * `compatible` is 'dmac,pl080'. The offsets NOT in the list above are the ones
 * this comment cannot vouch for from the binary — see the refusals below.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS MODEL REFUSES, BY NAME
 *
 * Each of these is counted, not silently ignored, so a guest that needs one is
 * visible in the counters instead of mysterious:
 *
 *   refused_flow    FlowCntrl 4-7 — the ones where the PERIPHERAL is the flow
 *                   controller and supplies the transfer size. This model has
 *                   no DMA request lines, so it cannot know when such a
 *                   transfer ends. The shipped tree only ever uses 0, 1, 2 and
 *                   3 (all "DMA controller is the flow controller"), which is
 *                   why those four run and these four do not.
 *   refused_width   a reserved width code (3-7), or a transfer whose total byte
 *                   count is not a whole number of DESTINATION transfers.
 *                   Mismatched source and destination widths themselves DO run
 *                   — /arm-io/spi1 uses them, four bytes in and one byte out —
 *                   but a remainder would be left sitting in the channel FIFO
 *                   this model does not have, and there is no Active bit it
 *                   could honestly set to say so. See run_item() in pl080.c for
 *                   which side Control[11:0] counts and how that was settled.
 *   refused_chain   an LLI chain longer than S5L_PL080_MAX_ITEMS. A list that
 *                   points at itself is a hung host, and real hardware has no
 *                   such limit; this one is ours and it is stated.
 *   refused_softreq a write to SoftBReq/SoftSReq/SoftLBReq/SoftLSReq (0x020,
 *                   0x024, 0x028, 0x02c). Software DMA requests only mean
 *                   something to the burst/single pacing this model does not
 *                   have. The stock driver writes none of the four.
 *   refused_endian  DMACConfiguration M1/M2 (bits 1-2). The whole machine is
 *                   little-endian; a guest asking for big-endian AHB masters
 *                   would get bytes this model does not swap.
 *
 * Also deliberately absent, with no counter because nothing can ask for them:
 * the PrimeCell identification registers at 0xfe0-0xffc. We have no dump of
 * Apple's PeriphID/PCellID values, the driver never reads one, and inventing
 * four constants would be exactly the fabrication this file exists to avoid.
 * They fall through to the unknown-offset log like any other unmodelled word.
 *
 * BURSTS AND REQUEST LINES ARE NOT MODELLED. SBSize/DBSize are stored and
 * ignored, and a channel with E set and H clear transfers as though its
 * peripheral always had a request pending. That is the one place this model is
 * knowingly faster than the part: audio moves at whatever rate the guest can
 * queue it, not at 44.1 kHz. It is what makes the capture record anything at
 * all, and it is not a claim about timing.

     * Has anything moved a device level since the last full refresh?
     *
     * THE MEASUREMENT. tools/insnbench prices s5l8900_tick(m, 1) at 543 ns
     * against ~84 ns for an interpreted instruction, so ticking once per
     * retired instruction costs about seven eighths of the interpreter's
     * throughput — 1.58 M/s measured against 6.68 M/s with the tick removed.
     * docs/dynarec.md §1.2's -21% is a reading from when the tick was a
     * divide, one timer and one VIC line; it now sweeps twelve devices, five
     * buttons and seven GPIO cascade groups and recomputes both VICs.
     *
     * WHAT THE FLAG BUYS. Almost all of that work is a LEVEL REFRESH, not a
     * time advance: re-reading the I2C/SPI/UART latches, re-driving the five
     * button pins through s5l_gpio_drive() (which snapshots all 25 pin words
     * per call), recomputing the seven cascade groups and both VIC outputs.
     * Every one of those steps is idempotent — see the "still high sets
     * nothing" note in s5l_gpioic_set_line() and the s5l_gpio_drive() comment
     * that makes s5l_buttons_apply() safe per-tick — so repeating it over
     * unchanged inputs cannot change the machine. The inputs change in exactly
     * three ways: elapsed timebase ticks, a guest access to a device window,
     * and a host reaching in behind the bus. The first is detected by the
     * accumulator; the second sets this flag at the bus interposer; the third
     * is what `s5l8900_tick(m, 0)` is for.
     *
     * WHY THE FAILURE MODE IS BENIGN. The skip only ever applies to a tick
     * that crossed NO timebase edge, and at 412 MHz against 6 MHz that is at
     * most 68 consecutive instructions. So a host that changes a level and
     * forgets to ask for a refresh delivers it up to 68 instructions late,
     * never not at all — unlike a wake-source deadline, where guessing wrong
     * loses the interrupt outright.
     *
     * WHAT IT MEASURED. insnbench's tick=yes rows went 1.58 -> 7.89 M/s with
     * the 4 KiB-page MMU and 1.83 -> 14.18 M/s without it, which leaves the
     * tick costing 3.4% of the MMU row rather than 76% of it. A real 300 M
     * instruction kernel boot through s5l8900_run() went 189.1 s -> 48.8 s,
     * and produced byte-identical guest console, framebuffer and machine
     * snapshot. Part of that is s5l_gpio_drive()'s own early out, which this
     * flag is what made worth having: it cut the remaining full refresh in
     * half, and the refresh is now what a real boot mostly pays for.
     *
     * Deliberately NOT serialised. It is derived state, and snapshot_load()
     * sets it rather than restoring it, so a loaded machine re-derives every
     * level once before it can observe anything. That is why the s5l8900_t

/* ------------------------------------------------------- address routing ---
 *
 * THE ROUTING CONTRACT. There is exactly one rule, and it is enforced at
 * construction rather than at every access:
 *
 *   RAM MAY NOT OVERLAP ANY WINDOW THIS MACHINE DECODES.
 *
 * s5l8900_init() refuses to build a machine whose RAM aperture would cover a
 * device window, and s5l8900_add_stub() refuses a window that would land inside
 * RAM. With that invariant held, "device wins" and "RAM wins" are the same
 * routing, so bus_read()/bus_write() are free to keep RAM on the fast path —
 * and a silent alias is not a bug that can be reintroduced, it is a machine
 * that cannot be constructed.
 *
 * The alternative contracts were considered and rejected:
 *
 *   - Let devices win at access time. The guest is still told through the
 *     device tree that it owns a contiguous DRAM bank, so the kernel would
 *     allocate pages inside the device window and quietly corrupt itself. It
 *     also costs a linear window scan on every RAM access.
 *   - Clamp RAM to the aperture. bootkernel publishes mem_size in boot_args and
 *     in /memory:reg from its OWN variable, so a clamp inside the machine just
 *     moves the lie: the guest would use DRAM the machine does not have.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. A DRAM window larger than the SoC's real aperture
 * necessarily covers physical regions the S5L8900 has (edram, vrom, SRAM — see
 * the memory-map block at the top of this header). We do not model those, so we
 * do not decode them and nothing is shadowed. The day one of them becomes a

 * How far a WFI may fast-forward, expressed as DATA rather than as a list of
 * devices baked into the wait itself.
 *
 * A core in WFI retires nothing, so the machine skips guest time to the first
 * moment an interrupt can arrive instead of spinning the host. That skip is an
 * optimisation, but it is one that decides what the guest can observe: a
 * source the wait does not know about is a source that cannot wake the CPU,
 * however correctly the device asserts its line, because time steps straight
 * over the tick it fired on. An idle SpringBoard sits in WFI, which is exactly
 * the state a touch, a GPIO edge or a USB event has to interrupt.
 *
 * So every modelled device that can raise an interrupt declares itself in the
 * table in core/src/soc/machine.c, and the wait takes the minimum. Adding a
 * device is a table entry, not an edit to the wait.
 *
 * The three-way answer is deliberately asymmetric, because the two ways of
 * being wrong are not equally bad. Waking too early only costs host time;
 * waking too late is a lost interrupt. S5L_WAKE_NEVER is therefore the ONLY
 * reply that lets guest time be skipped past a source, and it means "this
 * device cannot fire from the state it is in" — stopped, masked, not scanning.
 * A source that merely finds the distance hard to work out must answer
 * S5L_WAKE_UNKNOWN, and the machine then does not fast-forward at all.
