/*
 * S5LBox — the PL080 DMA controllers.
 *
 * The property being defended is not "the registers store what was written".
 * It is that the exact sequence AppleARMPL080DMAC performs — power the block,
 * clear every channel, program four registers from a linked-list item, set the
 * enable bit — moves the exact bytes to the exact addresses and then raises the
 * exact interrupt the driver's filter reads, and that everything this model
 * does NOT implement is refused by name with a counter rather than quietly
 * doing nothing.
 *
 * The register offsets and bit positions below are written as literals rather
 * than through the PL080_* macros on purpose, for the reason
 * core/tests/test_buttons.c transcribes the device tree by hand: a test that
 * spells its expectations with the model's own constants agrees with the model
 * by construction and checks nothing. Each literal's provenance is the
 * disassembly address in the PL080 block of soc.h.
