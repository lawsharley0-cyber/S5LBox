/*
 * S5LBox — WM8991 codec and I2S window tests.
 *
 * The properties defended here are the ones the shipped driver actually
 * depends on, each traced to the instruction that depends on it:
 *
 *   - register 0 reads 0x8990, MSB first on the wire   (cmp at 0xc068b0b0)
 *   - register 1 bit 5 does NOT read back              (test at 0xc068b0ec)
 *   - register 0x12 bit 12 mirrors 0x17 bit 12         (poll at 0xc068d4ac)
 *   - both write encodings decode by length            (0xc0540050 / 0xc0540108)
 *   - the seven I2S offsets are storage, the rest visible
 *
 * They are driven through the real controller wherever possible, using the
 * exact stock register sequence, so a change to the I2C model that broke the
 * codec would fail here rather than only in a four-minute boot.
